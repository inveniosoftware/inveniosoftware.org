The 19th annual [Open Repositories conference](https://or2024.openrepositories.org/) took place June 3 - 6, 2024 in Göteborg, Sweden. Attendees benefitted from hundreds of [presentations](https://zenodo.org/communities/openrepos/records?q=&f=subject%3AOR2024&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) on innovations in the world of digital repositories, all focused around this year's conference themes of Community, Transparency, and Sustainability. In addition, ten workshops were presented on June 3rd, the InvenioRDM Workshop being one of only two to receive a full-day allotment. 

At our third annual OR [InvenioRDM Workshop](https://zenodo.org/communities/inveniordm-workshop-2024), over a dozen of our community members collaborated to present and discuss the software, and to showcase features and customizations currently in place at our own institutions. These include:

- Caltech's [guide to customizing templates, vocabularies, and the deposit form](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12583898)
- NYU's [multiple storage configuration](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12686857)
- University of Bamberg's [UI-customizations, custom subjects and vocabularies, and deployment concept](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12583809)
- TU Wien's [innovations on authentication and digital preservation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12583693)
- University of Münster's use of [Devbox to provide a streamlined InvenioRDM installation and development experience](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12554567)
- Northwestern University's implementation of [Signposting in InvenioRDM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12554416)
- CERN's demo of the [Zenodo and CDS installations](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12554030), as well as a v12 features demo
- KTH Royal Institute of Technology's [customizations of InvenioRDM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12553429)

In the afternoon, we offered two separate tracks. In the first we hosted self-organizing technical discussions, including a hands-on demonstration of Devbox presented by project partners from Uni Münster. We also encouraged participants to install InvenioRDM on their machines with help from technical experts, many of whom had already spoken in the earlier showcase session.

In the second track, we focused on community discussions with two additional presentations:

- [The InvenioRDM Community](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12574995): what it is and how to join
- [Supporting Transparency and Compliance with InvenioRDM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12587111), a presentation from Northwestern on how InvenioRDM's features support compliance with the increasing number of public access and data sharing requirements for researchers

An informal survey of our 30+ participants afterward revealed that the workshop was generally very favorably received. Participants enjoyed the general introduction to the platform, as well as feature demonstrations and the opportunity to speak with members of the community. While some participants found installation challenging, others found deployment easy. Overall, participants found the experience to be valuable, with some encouraging us to offer the workshop again next year with minor tweaks.

Our active community participated in more than just the InvenioRDM workshop, however. Project partners also participated in:

- [The Repository Rodeo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12527422): Alex Ioannidis on behalf of Zenodo
- A Data Repositories and Lessons Learned presentation from KTH on the [KTH data repository based on InvenioRDM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12579325)
- An outline of Zenodo's role in the [Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/generalist-repository-ecosystem-initiative), presented by Northwestern University, in [Empowering Global Progress: GREI Coopetition's Role in Standardizing Transparency, Community, and Sustainability Initiatives](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12784019)
- 24x7 session on Integrations for Sustainability and Transparency: NYU's presentation [We Can Work It Out: Cross-Functional Collaboration on Repository Strategy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12548292)
- A Developer Track session, [Repositories and Computation: Crossover Episode](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12542572) presented by TU Wien

At the end of the conference, it was announced that the next Open Repositories will be hosted in Chicago from June 15 - 18, 2025. We will aim to host an InvenioRDM workshop once again, and we hope to see you there!
