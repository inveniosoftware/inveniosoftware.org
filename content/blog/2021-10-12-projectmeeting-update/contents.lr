On September 28-29 the InvenioRDM project team gathered again (though sadly, again, without fondue) for the Virtual Project meeting. Over 50 partners and team members were present and a great deal of helpful feedback was shared as we worked to develop the roadmap for the next stage of the project. Thanks to everyone for your contributions to the discussion, they are much appreciated!

The InvenioRDM project team would not be so robust without the thoughtful contribution of each of its members. Thank you to all of you who were able to commit the requested 1.5 person months to the project for the next year, in some cases more. The work of each partner site results in unique and valuable contributions to the team. We’d like to use this post to highlight, in a summarized format, the contributions that each project partner highlighted for us at the meeting. Here’s the amazing compendium of work that you have contributed over the past year:
