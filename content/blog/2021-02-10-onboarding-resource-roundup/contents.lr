body:

Congratulations! Your team has just joined the InvenioRDM open source project and is eager to contribute as much as possible. With a mixture of dedicated developers, resource curators, subject matter experts, and various leadership stakeholders, your team simply needs to know about the available resources and how to get started. Read on!


### Developers

Whether you would like to install and customize InvenioRDM, contribute on the main project sprints, or take on development of a module locally to contribute back to the project, there are a few important points of entry to participation:

- [Roadmap](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/roadmap/): Familiarize yourself with the overall project timeline and goals. Stable releases will be made through Summer 2021 on a monthly basis

- [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open): Get to know the specific milestones for 2021

- [Sprintboard](https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/63): See the planning board for the current sprint

- [Documentation](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/): Read the official project documentation

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/8qatqBC): Ask questions in the project Discord (chat/video platform) and introduce yourself in either the general or newcomers-help channels. A daily developer standup takes place on Discord at 15:15 UTC

- [Discourse](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/): Want to provide feedback, but in a less time-sensitive manner than a chat? Either join or start a thread in the Discourse discussion forum

- [Development Setup](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/develop/): Install a development version

- [Development Workflows](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/maintenance/development_workflow/): Learn about the development workflows used

### Community Members

All stakeholders at your institution are welcome to contribute to InvenioRDM, whether their contribution is code-based or not. To create a tool to best serve the community, outlining stakeholder requirements will be vital:

 - [Demo site](https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/): Access the latest sandbox version of InvenioRDM here. Create an account to test record creation

 - [Discourse](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/): Provide feedback on testing here. Use the [Feedback](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/c/site-feedback/2) category or start a new thread wherever you like

 - [Metadata Interest Group](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/metadata-interest-group/144): This is the first community-focused group organized to help support the InvenioRDM development effort. This group meets about once/month and discusses issues related to the [InvenioRDM Metadata Model](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/). To join, either make a post on the [Discourse thread](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/metadata-interest-group/144) or in this dedicated [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/hqvDW9p7Cx)

 - [Conference Calendar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhGtd39TqxleUkK-b5qyPqMjSg8EBqacxSpoDtydmE8/edit?usp=sharing): Are you presenting on InvenioRDM at an upcoming conference? Make a note here so other interested members of the community can attend the session, or perhaps join your poster or presentation effort

 - Welcome, Help and General Questions: Reach out to Community Manager Sara Gonzales via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/saragon7740) for general questions or to join the Metadata Interest Group

 - Schedule a Demo: Is your site, or a site you know, considering implementing InvenioRDM? Reach out to Community Manager Sara Gonzales via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/saragon7740) to schedule a one-hour demo and information session about the repository
 

 ### Everyone

 - Project list-serv: Lars will have shared this email address with you upon joining the team. This is the frontline communication tool for the InvenioRDM community. Make this email address a safe sender to receive the latest updates on teleconferences (a.k.a. telecons) and community-based information such as invitations to the Metadata Interest Group meetings. Polls, forms, and additional community tools will be sent to this list-serv

 - Telecons (see the list-serv for connection information): All partners of the InvenioRDM community are invited to bi-weekly telecons throughout the year. One telecon per month will focus on development updates, and the other will focus on community-based topics

 - [InvenioRDM Telecon Schedule 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ks5_xEMujd6vdlSmYGrbCsKP_I2hZasMkg-RIjwxbKg/edit?usp=sharing)

 - [Blog](https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/): You are reading it! The blog will also alternate between development-based and community-based topics. Would you like to contribute a blog post? [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Zupy06bKPdJMiLJDsfsgKZLgRJnbuj70AUCY1bOA0w/edit?usp=sharing) or contact Sara to get on the schedule
