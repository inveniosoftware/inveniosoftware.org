### Communities enhancements

**Subcommunities**

InvenioRDM v13.0 introduces hierarchical relationships between communities through subcommunities. This allows for structured organization, where records from child communities are automatically indexed in parent communities.
A dedicated "Browse" page lists subcommunities and collections, providing a clear overview.

**Collections**

Collections are a powerful new feature enabling dynamic, query-based groupings of records that automatically update. Collections provide dedicated pages for records matching specific criteria and can be organized hierarchically by subject, resource type, funding program, or other metadata fields. This is ideal for grouping content by research disciplines, publication dates, or funding programs.

**Curation checks**

It is now possible to configure automated checks in your communities to provide instant feedback on draft review and record inclusion requests.
Checks provide feedback to both the user and reviewer that submissions to your community are compliant with your curation policy.

### Audit Logs

A significant addition is audit logs, a new feature designed for tracking system activities and providing a detailed record of events accessible from the administration panel.

Jobs are triggered via the admin UI or REST API, run using Celery, and support logging, argument validation, and result tracking.
