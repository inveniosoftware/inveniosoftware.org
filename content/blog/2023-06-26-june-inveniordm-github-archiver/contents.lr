The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) is a new software tool created by the Caltech Library. [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/) is the basis for many institutional repositories, such as [CaltechDATA](https://data.caltech.edu/), that enable users to preserve software and data sets in a long-term archive. The metadata contained in the record of a deposit is critical to making the record widely discoverable by other people. However, creating detailed records and uploading assets can be a tedious and error-prone process if done manually. This is where our new tool comes in. 

IGA creates metadata records and sends releases automatically from GitHub to an InvenioRDM-based repository server. It constructs a metadata record using information it gathers from the software release, the GitHub repository, the GitHub API, and various other APIs as needed. Here are some of IGA’s other notable features:

- Automatic metadata extraction from GitHub releases, repositories, and ``codemeta.json`` and ``CITATION.cff`` files
- Thorough coverage of [InvenioRDM record metadata](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata) using painstaking procedures
- Recognition of identifiers that appear in CodeMeta and CFF files, including [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/), [ROR](https://ror.org/), [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), and [PMCID](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/public-access-info/)
- Automatic lookup of publication data in [DOI.org](https://www.doi.org/), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Google Books, & other sources if needed
- Automatic lookup of organization names in [ROR](https://ror.org/) (assuming ROR id’s are provided)
- Automatic lookup of human names in [ORCiD.org](https://orcid.org/) if needed (assuming ORCID id’s are provided)
- Automatic splitting of human names into family and given names using [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)-based methods if necessary
- Support for record versioning
- Support for InvenioRDM [communities](https://invenio-communities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Support for overriding the metadata record IGA creates, for complete control if you need it
- Ability to use the GitHub API without a [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in many cases
- Extensive use of logging so you can see what’s going on under the hood

Data and software archived in a repository need to be described thoroughly and richly cross-referenced in order to be widely discoverable by other people. Of particular interest to software developers is that a repository like CaltechDATA offers the means to preserve software projects in a long-term archive managed by their institution. IGA helps make the creation of metadata and InvenioRDM records for software and data managed in GitHub as easy as possible.
