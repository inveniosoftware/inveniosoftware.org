    <p>We aim at releasing a <strong>Long-Term Support (LTS)</strong> version by summer 2021.</p>

    <p>From February 2021 until summer 2021, we will be releasing <strong>stable</strong>
    versions of InvenioRDM on a monthly/bi-monthly basis that you can
    upgrade between.</p>

    <p>We consider large-scale production validation to have
    completed as soon as Zenodo is running on top of InvenioRDM (planned
    after the LTS release).</p>

      <p>
        <strong>What does a stable release mean?</strong> <br />
        A stable release means that we will provide an upgrade path to a
        subsequent version (manual or automatic). You should assign efforts to
        upgrade to the latest stable release continuously as we will only
        provide bug fixes or security updates to the
        <em>latest stable version</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What will change between stable releases?</strong> <br />
        Each stable release will usually add new features or improve on
        existing. We try to limit as much as possible changes to existing
        features, however we cannot exclude that changes might be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>When is the roadmap updated?</strong> <br />
        We update the roadmap quartly according to the current progress and
        available resources. Next update: January, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How did you estimate the required effort?</strong> <br />
        The detailed tasks and their associated estimated efforts are available
        in our <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm">developer roadmap</a> on GitHub which is tracking the
        current project progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I help accelerate the roadmap?</strong> <br />
        We will be happy to explore with you, how you can best help accelerate the
        roadmap. Please get in touch with the Product Manager (<a href="mailto:lars.holm.nielsen@cern.ch">lars.holm.nielsen@cern.ch</a>).

        <p>
          <strong>What does Long-Term Support mean?</strong> <br />
          Long-Term Support (LTS) means that we will provide bug fixes and
          security updates for minimum 1 year or until and including the next
          the LTS release. If resources allow, support <em>may</em> be extended
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When can I run InvenioRDM in production?</strong> <br />
          It depends on your requirements and needs. You can deploy a stable
          release for a smaller userbase if you have the resources to
          continuously upgrade the repository and the InvenioRDM feature set
          satisfies your needs. If you need a fully featured repository, wait
          until the LTS release. If you need a large-scale production
          validated repository, wait until Zenodo is running on InvenioRDM.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When is feature X ready?</strong> <br />
          Please see the roadmap below (for further details please see our <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm">developer roadmap</a>). Note that, there is a risk that tasks may
          be shuffled around between months depending on available resources
          with each partner. Tasks may also be brought forward if a partner
          finds resources, or similarly be delayed if a partner pulls out
          resources.
