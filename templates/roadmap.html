                Our roadmap helps us share what the Invenio community is
                working on next and the direction that weâ€™re taking Invenio.
                The roadmap is meant to open a practical dialogue on the
                direction of Invenio, and the roadmap may be subject to change
                both on the near-term and future plans based on feedback.

                <p>Invenio development is being led by CERN with contributions from institutions and individuals from all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>Every 3 months, CERN runs one to two 2-weeks development sprints dedicated to part of the above roadmap. Overall, this roughly amounts
                    to 1 FTE (full-time equivalent) per year plus the Invenio Product Manager.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, new modules/features, enhancements, security fixes, etc. are being developed every day by
                    teams at CERN and elsewhere.</p>
