      <p>
        Invenio is an open source project that was initially developed by CERN.
        The Invenio brand today covers a suite of currently three main products
        developed by the Invenio community:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>InvenioRDM - a repository/document management platform</li>
        <li>InvenioILS - an integrated library system</li>
        <li>Invenio Framework - a code library to build large-scale information
          systems such as InvenioRDM and InvenioILS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to the three main products, a larger number of smaller
        generic code libraries are also being maintained for the benefit of
        the open source commuinty independently of Invenio.

    <span class="section-title">History</span>
    <div clas="row">
      <p>
        Originally, Invenio v1, was a software application that acted as both a
        digital repository and an integrated library system based on MARC21. The first
        release of Invenio (named CDSWare back then) was on August 1st, 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, Invenio v3 was rewritten from scratch in order to better support
        large-scale research data management use cases as well as take advantage
        of significant developments in open source off-the-shelf solutions which
        didn't exist back in 2002. Invenio v3 also marked the departure from
        MARC21 as the core metadata format, towards a fully JSON-based system
        supporting many different metadata formats and not only MARC21.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invenio v3 further marked the split of Invenio into several separate products
        each focusing on specific use cases, but all based on the same core
        Invenio Framework v3.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about Invenio v2? Please don't ask (number 2 is always bad right?) ðŸ˜€
