This sprint was focused on:
- Metadata bundle: Finalize Invenio-Records, Invenio-Search, Invenio-JSONSchemas.
- Fixing new bugs in Base/Auth bundles.

As a result of 40 developer days, 37 commits and 2.8k lines touched (2k additions and 0.8k deletions), the following improvements were implemented:
- Fixed bouncing of search results (sorting of the same query could change depending on which Elasticsearch node your query would be answered by).
- JSONB now being used for record storage (Thanks to Javier for the PR).
- Rendering of JSONSchemas, meaning `allOf` and `$refs` can now be resolved on-the-fly to generate an self-contained schema for e.g. deposit forms (Thanks to Pamfilos for the PR).
- Boring fixes that makes sure the Base and Auth bundles are stable.
