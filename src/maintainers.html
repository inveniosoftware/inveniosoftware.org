    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Maintainers are a key part of the Invenio open source community. They help
      ensure the health, quality, and sustainability of the codebase while
      fostering a welcoming environment for contributors. This document defines
      the role of maintainers, their responsibilities, how to become a
      maintainer, and related processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Role of Maintainers</h2>
    <p>
      Maintainers are individuals who have demonstrated expertise and commitment
      to the Invenio project. They maintain at least one Invenio software
      repository and are appointed by the Principal Architect, in accordance
      with the Product Manager.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Maintainers have responsibilities across several key areas:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technical Leadership:</strong> Maintainers participate in
      architectural discussions, make technical decisions, and evaluate
      contributions for community reusability. They help shape the technical
      architecture in coordination with the Principal Architect and manage
      releases according to the <a href="/governance/">principles</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/80">roadmap</a>.
      They may specialize in specific areas of the framework such as
      translations, infrastructure, metadata schemas, or UI/UX.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Code Quality and Repository Management</strong>: Maintainers
      review pull requests, test new changes, manage issues, prepare releases,
      backport changes when necessary, and address security vulnerabilities.
      They ensure contributions follow best practices and are aligned with
      project goals. A minimum of two maintainers should agree before merging
      significant changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Community Support</strong>: Maintainers guide newcomers, answer
      questions and share their expertise on communication channels (GitHub,
      Discord, Discourse), help engage contributors, and ensure adequate
      documentation for repositories. They identify testers and reviewers for
      complex PRs and participate in merge parties during telecons and events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fostering Best Practices:</strong> Maintainers exemplify the Code
      of Conduct and maintain a supportive environment for contributors. They
      use GitHub boards to organize work, proactively address technical debt,
      and seek input from other maintainers when reviewing unfamiliar changes.
      Regular participation in community events and an active presence in
      communication channels helps maintain project momentum.
    </p>
