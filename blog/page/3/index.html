    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>We are pleased to announce the InvenioRDM April release. The Deposit page has been our focus and that meant designing the frontend and the backend based on lessons learned from the beta invenio-deposit python module and from the invenio-records-js and invenio-files-js previous angularjs modules. We will be implementing most of these designs in May.</p>
<p>Thank you all for testing the last release and for your many contributions.</p>
<h3>Some Highlights include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requests for comments (RFCs) from the numerous conversations. These are living and changing documents.<ul>
<li>Deposit frontend: <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/issues/27">https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/issues/27</a></li>
<li>Deposit backend: <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/issues/22">https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/issues/22</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two new modules have been created to improve the REST API and deal with the deposit backend<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/flask-resources">https://github.com/inveniosoftware/flask-resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-resources">https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-resources</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the frontend we have added a proof of concept deposit page with 2 fields (title and resource type).</li>
<li>These are in part powered by an improved controlled vocabulary backend and an all-new React frontend.</li>
<li>This page is accessible through the Upload link of the search page.</li>
<li>Invenio-S3 v1.0.3 has been released with better big file upload support</li>
<li>Various dependency fixes have been applied and the cookiecutter slugification made more solid</li>
<li>Auto-reloading of webpack has been made possible allowing us to work much more effectively with React</li>
</ul>
<h3>Want to get involved?</h3>
<p>Although in this release, we haven’t made significant visual changes, you are always welcomed to try new releases - invenio-cli v0.12.X, this time around- by following the documentation site: <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/">https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/</a> . Give us feedback on Discourse: <a href="https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/inveniordm-alpha-6-april-release/104">https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/inveniordm-alpha-6-april-release/104</a> for this release.</p>
<p>As mentioned, apart from the /deposits/new proof of concept page you won’t see much other differences. Take it easy this time. We will be asking a lot of feedback from you next month!</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest, take care and stay safe!</p>

      <p>We are proud to announce the release of Invenio v3.2.0. With this release,
Invenio v3.0.x reaches end of life, and will no longer be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Python compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Invenio v3.2 supports Python 2.7 (until 2019-12-31), Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>See our <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/maint-3.2/quickstart/quickstart.html">quick start</a> guide.</p>
<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<p>See our <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/maint-3.2/upgrading.html">upgrade guide</a>.</p>
<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Please see the full <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/maint-3.2/releases/v3.2.0.html">release notes</a> for
details about minor changes, deprecations etc.</p>
<h1>Highlights for Invenio v3.2</h1>
<h2>Files bundle</h2>
<p>We have released four new modules as part of the new Files bundle:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://invenio-files-rest.readthedocs.io">Invenio-Files-REST</a>: Object store REST API for managing files in Invenio.</li>
<li><a href="http://invenio-records-files.readthedocs.io">Invenio-Records-Files</a>: Integration layer between records and files.</li>
<li><a href="http://invenio-previewer.readthedocs.io">Invenio-Previewer</a>: File previewers support.</li>
<li><a href="http://invenio-iiif.readthedocs.io">Invenio-IIIF</a>: IIIF Image API support for thumbnail and zooming on images.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand more about how to use the new Files bundle see our integration
guide on <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/handling-files.html">https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/handling-files.html</a>.</p>
<h2>Elasticsearch v7 support</h2>
<p>Invenio now supports Elasticsearch v7.</p>
<h2>Marshmallow 3 compatibility</h2>
<p>Invenio now support both Marshmallow v2 or v3. The support is done via a
compatibility layer, that allows Invenio to work with either schemas from v2 or
v3. This should allow users to upgrade to Invenio v3.2 without being forced to
upgrade their Marshmallow schemas immediately to v3.</p>
<p>We advice all users to start planning an upgrade of their Marshmallow schemas
from v2 to v3 as the upgrade is non-trivial and needs proper testing due to
significant differences between Marshmallow v2 and v3.</p>
<p>Invenio will continue support for both Marshmallow v2 and v3 for a transition
period to allow users to upgrade at their own pace. After the transition period
Marshmallow v2 support will be deprecated and removed from Invenio.</p>
<p>For information about how to upgrade see <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/upgrade-marshmallow.html">https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/upgrade-marshmallow.html</a>.</p>
<h2>Search index prefixing</h2>
<p>Elasticsearch does not support the concept of virtual hosts and thus with
previous versions of Invenio it was not possible to share an Elasticsearch
cluster between multiple Invenio instances.</p>
<p>We have now added support for index/alias/template prefixing, so that all
names can be prefixed with a string and thus allows multiple Invenio instances
to share an Elasticsearch cluster. Note, that this is only name prefixing, thus
technically two Invenio instances will can read each other indexes and thus
must trust each other.</p>
<p>Read more about the new feature on
<a href="https://invenio-search.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#index-prefixing">https://invenio-search.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#index-prefixing</a>.</p>
<h1>Maintenance policy</h1>
<p>Invenio v3.2 will be supported with bug and security fixes until the release of
Invenio v3.4 and minimum until 2020-12-20.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/maint-3.2/releases/maintenance-policy.html">maintenance policy</a>.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In Invenio v3.3 we are planning to release the <strong>Statistics</strong> bundle including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://invenio-stats.readthedocs.io">invenio-stats</a><ul>
<li>Invenio module for statistical data processing and querying with support
for collecting COUNTER Research Data Usage Metrics compliant statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://counter-robots.readthedocs.io">counter-robots</a><ul>
<li>Library for COUNTER-compliant detection of machines and robots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Statistics bundle, we will also release final versions of
the following two modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://invenio-index-migrator.readthedocs.io">invenio-index-migrator</a><ul>
<li>Elasticsearch index migrator for Invenio (aka zero down-time reindexing
and index migration).</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <p>We're happy to announce a major overhaul of inveniosoftware.org. Some of the
highlights of the new website include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebranding of Invenio into three products: InvenioRDM, InvenioILS and
Invenio Framework</li>
<li>A new forum</li>
<li>People in the community</li>
<li>Logo downloads</li>
</ul>
<h2>Framework, RDM and ILS</h2>
<p>The primary reason for the website overhaul is a rebranding of Invenio
into three different products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/products/rdm/"><strong>InvenioRDM</strong></a> - a turn-key research data management repository.</li>
<li><a href="/products/ils/"><strong>InvenioILS</strong></a> - an Integrated Library System.</li>
<li><a href="/products/framework/"><strong>Invenio Framework</strong></a> - a core framework for large-scale digital repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both, InvenioRDM and InvenioILS are applications built on top of the Invenio
Framework. On each product page, you'll find a lot more information about the
product as well as their current roadmaps.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-10-15-web-redesign/website-screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>Talk - Discourse forum</h1>
<p>We are also launching a <a href="https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch">new forum</a>
for both users, administrators and developers, which replaces our current
<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/troubleshooting">troubleshooting repository</a> on GitHub
and compliments the current chatrooms.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-10-15-web-redesign/forum.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>People and institutions in the community</h1>
<p>We have also added a new <a href="/people/">people section</a> to better showcase the
persons who are making Invenio into a real community. Don't hesitate to email us
if you'd like to be displayed on the list.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-10-15-web-redesign/people.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>New logos</h1>
<p>Last but not least, we've made some very minor modifications to the Invenio
logo, as well as made a dedicated <a href="/about/">download page</a> where you can get
SVG versions of all logos.</p>

      <p>Two CERN sprint teams with a total of 14 developers have just each finished a two-week sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint team 1: Focused on the Invenio v3.2 release which will include the new  Files bundle.</li>
<li>Sprint team 2: Focused on adding Elasticsearch 7 support as well prepare  the Invenio v3.3 release which will include the new index migration utilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>A total of 23 new module releases where made during the sprint.  The highlights from the two sprints include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch 7 support.</li>
<li>Elasticsearch index prefixing and suffixing support for shared clusters (this is needed for the upcoming index migrator utilities).</li>
<li>Marshmallow v2 and v3 compatibility. Invenio is now able to accept both Marshmallow v2 and v3 schemas. In your Invenio instance you will need to pin the Marshmallow version that matches your schemas, and follow the upgrade guide provided by Marshmallow to upgrade your schemas.</li>
<li>Sentry support is now using the Sentry-Python library instead of Raven library (you can still switch back to Raven by setting <code>SENTRY_SDK = False</code> in your configuration).</li>
<li>Rate limiting now differentiates between guests and authenticated users, and allows for external modules to provide per user rate limits.</li>
<li>Improved HTML sanitisation support in several modules.</li>
<li>Improved support for client-side infinite scroll in the REST API.</li>
<li>Housekeeping: we have fixed a significant number of  build failures as well as deprecation warnings from other libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of above highlights will be released together with Invenio v3.2. Most of the individual modules have already been released, however you are still on your own if you decide to go head with them prior to the Invenio v3.2 release (if you encounter problems, we are of course very interested in hearing about it, so that we can solve them before the v3.2 release).</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<h3>Invenio v3.2 and Files Bundle</h3>
<p>The primary focus is still to release Invenio v3.2. The  pending issues are limited to final testing and documentation.</p>
<h3>Elasticsearch v2 and v5 deprecation</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.3 will add index migration utilities that will allow Invenio users to   upgrade their Elasticsearch clusters to supported Elasticsearch versions. In Invenio v3.4 we plan to then remove support for Elasticsearch v2 and v5.</p>
<h3>Python v2 support ends January 1st 2020.</h3>
<p>Python v2.7 will reach end of life on January 1st, 2020. Invenio will only support Python 2.7 until that date. From January 1st, 2020 we will remove Python 2.7 from our test matrixes, and thus new module releases after January 1st 2020 will very likely no longer work on Python 2.7.</p>
<p>We are already seeing a large number of our dependent Python libraries that have removed Python 2 support, and thus we will not be able to continue Python 2 support beyond January 1st, 2020.</p>
<h3>Invenio v3.3 - Index migration and usage statistics</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.3 is planned for release in late 2019 or early 2020.  The primary focus for Invenio v3.3 will be adding support for Elasticsearch index migration as well as releasing the Statistics Bundle (COUNTER-compliant usage statistics). The Statistics Bundle includes the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio-Stats</li>
<li>Invenio-Queues</li>
<li>COUNTER-Robots</li>
</ul>
<p>Invenio v3.3 may also see the release of a new module, Invenio-Records-Permissions, which will significantly simplify the defining and managing access control for records.</p>

      <p>Two vulnerabilities have been identified in <em>supported</em> Invenio modules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invenio-Records</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-records/security/advisories/GHSA-vxh3-mvv7-265j">security advisory</a>): A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Invenio-Records in the administration interface.</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-App</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app/security/advisories/GHSA-94mf-xfg5-r247">security advisory</a>): A Host header injection vulnerability has been identified in Invenio-App.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two XSS vulnerabilities have been discovered in <em>unsupported</em> Invenio modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invenio-Previewer</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-previewer/security/advisories/GHSA-j9m2-6hq2-4r3c">security advisory</a>): An XSS vulnerability affecting the JSON, Markdown and iPython Notebook previewers.</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-Communities</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/security/advisories/GHSA-mfv8-q39f-mgfg">security advisory</a>): An XSS vulnerability affecting the Jinja templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vulnerabilities were found after an XSS vulnerability was reported to Zenodo by Ciro Santilli. As a standard measure and after patching Zenodo, we reviewed the Invenio source code for potential similar issues to those identified in the Zenodo source code. This led to the discovery of three additional XSS vulnerabilities. The host header injection vulnerability was discovered after a standard vulnerability scan of another service running at CERN.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>We have issued two new Invenio releases fixing these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio v3.0.2 and v3.1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>The following individual modules fixing the vulnerabilities have been released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio-Records v1.0.2, v1.1.1 and v1.2.2</li>
<li>Invenio-App v1.0.6 and v1.1.1</li>
<li>Invenio-Previewer v1.0.0a12 (unsupported)</li>
<li>Invenio-Communities v1.0.0a20 (unsupported)</li>
</ul>
<h3>New security policy</h3>
<p>We have taken the chance during handling of these vulnerabilities to also clearly define and document Invenio's <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/security-policy.html">security policy</a>. Please have a look and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Previously, we have sometimes privately notified potentially affected services about a security vulnerability. We have however decided to discontinue this practice, and instead, send out an advance notification to everyone about an upcoming security release including only the severity level of the issue. This allows everyone to plan ahead for the upcoming release and ensure they have staff available to handle the release. This partially smoothens the communication process but also ensures that everyone receives the same information in a scalable approach.</p>
<h3>GitHub security advisors</h3>
<p>As a new thing, we have also evaluated the new GitHub <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories">maintainer security advisories</a> to handle the vulnerabilities. These advisories are reviewed by GitHub and should allow a security alert to be sent to affected repositories.</p>

      <p><strong>In our latest Invenio sprint from May 13-24 we've been working on making Elasticsearch upgrades, migration and reindexing simpler and with near zero downtime. Read on, to learn more about how you keep up with Elasticsearch rapid release and deprecation cycles with Invenio and for a preview of what will come of new features in Invenio v3.2.</strong></p>
<h2>End of life</h2>
<p>Once you start running a production Invenio instance, you'll quickly notice that your Elasticsearch cluster will become outdated pretty fast, due to Elasticsearch's rapid release and deprecation cycle. Invenio v3 development was started in 2016 against the newly released Elasticsearch v2. When Invenio v3 was finally released in June 2018, Elasticsearch has had two major releases (v5 and v6) and v2 had already reached end of life. As can be seen from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/support/eol">Elastic Product End of Life Dates</a>, you can expect a major Elasticsearch version to be supported for a maximum of 2-3 years. Thus, you should plan to regularly upgrade your Elasticsearch cluster in order to not run on unmaintained software.</p>
<h2>Index upgrades with downtime</h2>
<p>Elasticsearch allows an index created in v5 to be read in v6 which combined with rolling cluster upgrades allows you to upgrade a cluster relatively easy with no downtime. However, you are out of luck as soon as you want to upgrade again from v6 to v7 since v7 cannot read an index created in v5.</p>
<p>The solution is for every major Elasticsearch upgrade to create a new index and reindex content from your old index. This requires you to take offline your Invenio instance to avoid that new content is indexed during the reindexing process. For large-scale production systems with many millions of records, reindexing can take a long time, and thus might require several hours of downtime, which can quickly be a big issue these systems.</p>
<h2>Fixing Elasticsearch mappings</h2>
<p>A related problem you may hit when running an Invenio instance is that you would like to tweak the Elasticsearch mappings in order to improve search performance and precision. In Elasticsearch you cannot modify the mapping of an existing index, thus similar to above, you need to create a new index and reindex content from the old index.</p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>All in all, you'll find yourself in need of tools to manage indexes and performing reindexing in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade an Elasticsearch cluster between major versions.</li>
<li>Migrate between two Elasticsearch clusters.</li>
<li>Change Elasticsearch mappings of existing indexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Near-zero downtime upgrade, migration and reindexing</h2>
<p>To solve the above use cases, we've built a new Invenio module named <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-index-migrator">Invenio-Index-Migrator</a>. The module allows you to synchronize two Elasticsearch indexes (in-cluster or cross-cluster) over an extended time period, and when you are ready, you can roll over the new index. Depending on how you have deployed Invenio, the rollover can happen with either zero downtime or near zero downtime (&lt;5 minutes compared to hours)</p>
<p>The new module supports migrating records but also any other index you may have in Elasticsearch such as event logging from usage statistics. The new module works by defining <strong>migration recipes</strong> and managing them via a CLI</p>
<h4>Demo</h4>
<p><em>Disclaimer: APIs etc may change slightly before the final release.</em></p>
<p>First, you initialize a migration recipe (here a recipe named <code>records</code>) which will create new indexes to hold the new data:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration init "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Next, you kick-off the index migration:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration run "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Index migration happens in two stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulk migration:</strong> First a snapshot of the current index is reindexing into the new index. Invenio-Index-Migrator is flexible an supports several methods. By default, we use the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html">Elasticsearch Reindex API</a> which in most cases are orders of magnitudes faster than any other method. Other methods allow you to use Invenio's default record indexing or simply implement your own.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Once the first snapshot has been fully indexed, a second job is started to keep the two indexes in sync. Essentially this works by indexing any modifications to the old index in the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any point during the migration, you can check the status:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration status "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Once you're ready, you can roll over the new index:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration rollover "records"
</code></pre>
<p>In an in-cluster migration, the rollover works by shuffling around index aliases (since Elasticsearch does not support renaming indexes). In a cross-cluster migration you update the Invenio configuration to point to your new Elasticsearch cluster.</p>
<p>In case something goes wrong during the index migration, you can of course also cancel the job:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration cancel "records"
</code></pre>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>During the sprint a number of other issues were addressed that will also be part of Invenio v3.2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch v7 support</strong> was added to Invenio-Search, Invenio-Indexer and Invenio-Records-REST. Only Invenio-OAIServer needs to be upgraded to support Elasticsearch 7.</li>
<li><strong>Search index prefixing</strong> allowing multiple Invenio instances to use the same Elasticsearch cluster. Elasticsearch by default does not support the concept of virtual hosts. With search indexing prefixing, it will be possible to use a single Elasticsearch cluster for multiple Invenio instances, given that the Invenio instances either trust each other, or you have a protection-layer like Elastic X-Pack or ReadonlyREST in front of Elasticsearch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The Invenio-Index-Migrator is only the first building blocks in order to make Elasticsearch upgrades, migration and reindexing simple. We hope to add assistant-like features that will make it even easier to keep with the latest Elasticsearch releases.</p>
<p>The Invenio-Index-Migrator will be finally released with Invenio v3.2 which is planned for July-September.</p>

      <p><strong>CERN has partnered with 10 multidisciplinary institutions and companies to build a turn-key open source research data management platform called InvenioRDM, and grow a diverse community to sustain the platform.</strong></p>
<p>The InvenioRDM project is funded by the <a href="https://kt.cern">CERN Knowledge Transfer Fund</a>, as well as all the participating partners,  including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bnl.gov">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu">Caltech Library</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/">CTSA Program National Center for Data to Health</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.data-futures.org">Data Futures</a> (UK)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tugraz.at">Graz University of Technology</a> (AT)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hzdr.de">Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a> (DE)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE</a> (GR)</li>
<li><a href="https://tind.io">TIND</a> (NO)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tubitak.gov.tr">Tubitak</a> (TK)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uni-hamburg.de">University of Hamburg</a> (DE)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/">University of Münster</a> (DE)</li>
</ul>
<p>The project has an ambitious one year schedule in which it will deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>InvenioRDM - A research data management platform based on <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> and <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org">Invenio v3 Framework</a>.</li>
<li>A community of public and private institutions to sustain InvenioRDM.</li>
<li>Minimum two existing repositories migrated to InvenioRDM, with Zenodo being one of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to successfully achieving the ambitious schedule is that InvenioRDM will be based on Zenodo that have already been successfully validated over the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Our vision in the next five-years, is to make InvenioRDM a world-leading extensible research data management platform used by research institutions all around the world and with businesses providing services, support and customizations on top of InvenioRDM.</p>
<h1>What is a RDM platform?</h1>
<p>An research data management (RDM) platform allows researchers to share and preserve scientific results. Researchers can share anything from publications, posters, presentations to datasets and software. Once a researcher have shared a result, they get a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), that allow them to properly cite their result.</p>
<p>There are three primary purposes of RDM is to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disseminate and archive</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable reproducibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable reuse</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, research funding agencies all over the world have realised the huge potential economic and social benefits of RDM to society and are now demanding solutions.</p>
<h1>Zenodo</h1>
<p><a href="http://home.cern">CERN</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE</a> has built one such RDM service with European Union funding called <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>. Zenodo has been highly successful and has in its 5 years of existence become a world-leading general purpose research data repositories.</p>
<p>In fact, other institutions have already taken Zenodo source code (which is open source), and started building their own local RDM solutions on it. The goal of this project is to join our efforts to build a common RDM-platform from which both CERN, other institutions and private businesses can profit.</p>
<h1>Multidisciplinary partners</h1>
<p>The real strength of the project is that it brings together a suite of partners from multidisciplinary domains, that each bring unique knowledge and know-how from their specific domains that will be critical to the success of project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional partners:<ul>
<li>University of Hamburg</li>
<li>University of Münster</li>
<li>Caltech Library</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health and medical science partners:<ul>
<li>Northwestern University</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics partners:<ul>
<li>Helmholz Zentrum Dreseden Rossendorf</li>
<li>Brookhaven National Laboratory</li>
<li>TUBITAK - The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Digital humanities partners:<ul>
<li>Data Futures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business partners:<ul>
<li>TIND Technologies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community partners:<ul>
<li>OpenAIRE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Building InvenioRDM</h1>
<p>InvenioRDM will include most of the features that Zenodo alreday include today such as e.g. DOI miniting capabilities, versioning support and COUNTER compliant usage statistics to name some few.</p>
<p>The work in transforming Zenodo into a general purpose RDM-platform will involve three key areas:</p>
<p><strong>Core repository</strong></p>
<p>The repository platform will at its core include an extensible metadata model based DataCite metadata schema with support for handling millions of records and peta bytes of data. The repository will further be aligned with the <a href="http://ngr.coar-repositories.org">Next Generation Repositories</a> (NGR) standard.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging and distribution</strong></p>
<p>Key for easy adoption of InvenioRDM is to ensure that it is a real turn-key solution requiring minimal experience in installing, operating and administering the platform, or in short getting users started in no time. Thus, a significant part of the efforts will go into simplifing the installation, improving the packaging and distribution, as well as providing excellent end-user documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Customization and extendability</strong></p>
<p>A key requirement for InvenioRDM is that it can easily be extended and customized just enough to adapt to each particular institution. This includes for instance defining authentication mechanisms (SAML/LDAP/OAuth), integrating with mutliple storage backend system, and most important of all to make these customizations easy.</p>

<p>The Invenio v3 Bootcamp was held from the 19th to the 21st of March, 2019 at CERN. The event reached the maximum number of 30 participants with attendees from all over the world (Czech Republic, Danmark, Germany, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, UK and USA).
The bootcamp was targeting developers wanting to learn more about Invenio and to understand how to create or customize an Invenio repository.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>The three days of the bootcamp was organised with a succession of talks and practical hands-on sessions, presented by 6 Invenio experts. Participants were able to develop each of the functionality on their laptop with a constant assistant in case of need.</p>
<p>The objective was to discover the Invenio framework and acquire knowledge on how to build a new repository by progressively introducing new concepts.</p>
<p>The main topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started with Invenio</li>
<li>Tour of functionalities and infrastructure</li>
<li>Customizations of data models and look &amp; feel</li>
<li>Deposit of new records and references between data models</li>
<li>Access control</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Deployment and application architecture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try it yourself</strong></p>
<p>We've made all the material publicly available for all those who couldn't participate in the event, so you can try out the same exercises at home:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/training">Training exercises</a></li>
<li><a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/773969/timetable/#all">Presentations on the event website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you run into troubles, we're happy to <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/getting-help.html">answer questions</a> you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>Participants had the opportunity to experience how to work with Invenio thanks to the hands-on sessions and to understand how to apply each of the introduced functionalities to use cases of their organization.</p>
<p>The bootcamp attracted quite a lot of interest for Invenio and participants were very involved and curious: we were very glad to answer to all of the interesting questions that were asked.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone for their participation and help to have contributed​ to the success of the event.</p>
<p><strong>Invenio User Group Workshop 2019 @ Open Repositories 2019, June 10th</strong></p>
