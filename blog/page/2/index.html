    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>We're happy to announce InvenioRDM v1.0!</p>
<p>VERY IMPORTANT, read the full release notes before you install and run the system! The v1.0 label <strong>does not</strong> mean the system is suitable for <strong>production</strong> use!</p>
<h1>FAQ (do not skip!)</h1>
<h3>Can I use v1.0 in production?</h3>
<p>No. Do not even try, or think it might work out!</p>
<h3>When can I use InvenioRDM in production?</h3>
<p>The first release of InvenioRDM that you can use in a production system will be the LTS (Long-Term Support) release due in end-July.</p>
<h3>Why the v1.0 label?</h3>
<p>We follow semantic versioning, and in the coming months we'll be releasing v2.0, v3.0, etc. We use the v1.0 label because we're now in a state where the project partners can start running demo systems to demonstrate the progress of the project to their stakeholders. Furthermore, the project partners will be able to start user testing more widely.</p>
<h3>Can I upgrade from v1.0 to v2.0?</h3>
<p>Read the upgrade contract below.</p>
<h1>Upgrade contract (do not skip!)</h1>
<p>The following "contract" is meant to align expectations on how and what you'll be able to upgrade from v1.0 to v2.0.</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> expect <strong>breaking changes</strong> to anything on subsequent releases until the LTS release! REST APIs, programmatic APIs, features, Jinja/React templates, data model, vocabularies, etc.</p>
<p>We will <strong>ONLY</strong> guarantee that you will be able to upgrade a database created with v1.0 to v2.0. With that, we mean that <strong>through a manual, labour intensive and offline process</strong> you'll be able to upgrade your database. Basically this boils down to, that we will document the steps you need to apply in order to move your data from v1.0 to v2.0 code. In no way do we promise it will be easy! You <strong>MAY</strong> need to apply manual changes to records. We of course plan to make this an easy and smooth process for the LTS release, but for now it's not.</p>
<h1>What's new?</h1>
<p>Now that you've hopefully read all the above and are very scared of installing InvenioRDM in production (you should be!), then let's share a bit of the excitement we have for the release this month.</p>
<p>We have reached a really major milestone for InvenioRDM. We now have a <em>minimal</em> working repository with a <em>minimal</em> acceptable user experience with a <em>very minimal</em> feature set. From now on, we are in a releaseable state! That means that in the coming months we'll be improving the UX, the feature set, the stability and production readiness, and thus we're in a very good position for accomplishing our production-ready LTS release in end-July.</p>
<p>Below you'll find the specific areas we've been working on this month.</p>
<h3>Access control</h3>
<p>The major new feature this month is the support for minimal access control.</p>
<p>The deposit form now has a new protection widget that allows you to deposit records in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public records with public files</li>
<li>Public records with restricted files (with or without embargo)</li>
<li>Restricted records with restricted files (with or without embargo)</li>
<li>Public metadata-only records</li>
<li>Restricted metadata-only records (with or without embargo).</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some examples of how this now looks in the deposit form:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/1_access_control_examples.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Restricted records and files</strong></p>
<p>Restricted records and files are only visible for the owner (the user who deposited the material). This means that e.g. a restricted record will not show up in the search results of other users.</p>
<p>User without access (no files and no edit button visible):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/2_access_control_restricted_files.png" alt=""></p>
<p>User with access (files and edit button visible):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/3_access_control_owner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note, that the message "Sorry, the files are restricted!" is a temporary message, until we have a solution for the access badge (see next section).</p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Access status</strong></p>
<p>We have temporarily removed the access status badge (see before/after screenshot below) until we have found a suitable solution for the badge. The current badge was not easily transferable to the new access control, and is mixing indications about if you can access a record, and/or if files are available.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/4_access_badge_before.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/5_access_badge_after.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Embargo feature</strong></p>
<p>You can apply an embargo period to restricted files or records. Once an embargo period is over the record/files are supposed to be made automatically publicly accessible. In v1.0 however, we were not able to include the background job responsible for doing this automatically.</p>
<p>We'll ship this task in the March v2.0 release.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Manage permissions</strong></p>
<p>Currently, only the owner is able to see a restricted record/files. In future releases, we'll of course add the support for managing permissions, so that restricted records and files can be shared with colleagues, groups and entire institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Access backend</strong></p>
<p>Underneath the hood, we have prepared the entire access control system to be able to share access with other users, communities, IP networks, etc. Thus, the backend part for allowing management of permissions is almost done, while we are primarily missing the frontend that allows an end-user to interact with the permission system.</p>
<h3>Minimal UX</h3>
<p><strong>Disabled unfinished features</strong></p>
<p>We have disabled all unfinished features from the user interface. We have for instance disabled the communities module, the version flip-switch in search results, a button to the advanced search and so on.</p>
<p>The features will be added back, once they have reached sufficient quality to be running in a demo system.</p>
<p><strong>Deposit form fields</strong></p>
<p>We have also removed all deposit form fields from the user interface that were not ready. Each of these fields will be added back progressively as they are finished. Most notably we e.g. had to remove the subjects field for this release.</p>
<p><strong>Field help text</strong></p>
<p>We have added help text to as many fields as possible. Please provide feedback, if they are understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Styling issues</strong></p>
<p>We have fixed a large number of small styling and consistentcy issues. Still some remain, and you're feedback is very much appreciated on anything you find in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<p>The list uploads page now has a nice greeting for first time users:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/6_list_uploads_empty.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, the overall styling of the page was improved:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/7_list_uploads_styling.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Search guide</strong></p>
<p>We have added a guide (taken from Zenodo) on how to perform advanced queries. See it on <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/help/search">https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/help/search</a>.</p>
<h3>Release v1.0</h3>
<p>We have gone through a lot of quality checking to ensure that we'll be able to upgrade data created with the v1.0 release to the coming v2.0 release. This work has focused on ensuring, for example, proper validation and integrity of the data that makes it into the database.</p>
<p>We have also ensured that all database tables have proper upgrade recipes for our automatic schema upgrade system (Alembic).</p>
<h1>Known issues</h1>
<p><strong>Landing page</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preview: The image previewer is not using IIIF and only previews images up to 500kb.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: If you e.g. upload a .JPG extension file, you can set the default preview for the file, but the list of files will not have a preview button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: The caption of the preview box does not change when selecting another file for preview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deposit form</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validation error messages: The form validation error messages are not displaying correctly. Labels are system names, and sometimes [Object (Object)] is displayed for errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Missing files: If files are missing to be uploaded, the publish button is disabled, but there no feedback to the end-user that files are missing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance: We have seen some slight performance issues when entering information into the form. We're looking into this, to make sure it is not noticeable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affiliations vocabulary: We have not initialized the affiliation vocabulary, and thus there is no auto-completion for affiliations (creators and contributors).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Publish button: It is not enabled when reloading a page with a valid record - you first have to save the record for the publish button to be enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protection: The files restriction in the protection widget only become visible after uploading a file. It should be hidden only for metadata-only records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages: The language vocabulary search results are not ranked properly for the query. For instance searching for "english" will show less relevant results first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creators: The list of creators in the deposit form does not display the role nor identifier if entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) in the description fields are not removed from the descriptions displayed in search results, causing them to be printed verbatim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Facet: The search facet distinguishing between published and drafts on the list uploads page is using system labels instead of human readable labels.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The title of a search result item is not clickable even though it looks clickable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embargo records are not automatically published due to the missing background job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The REST API JSON serialization has timestamps that are not in UTC, nor do they have timezone information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some versions of NPM 7 are <em>known</em> to cause issues -- NPM 6.14.5 is recommended.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>2020 didn't stop us from shipping new releases. 2021 won't either. We’re excited to announce the InvenioRDM Alpha 15 (January release)! Thank you to our team members for their efforts on this release.</p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>This month was primarily dedicated to improving the user experience of the deposit form.</p>
<p>We have made significant improvements to the overall user experience of the deposit form. That said, we still have many smaller UX improvements to make. This work will continue throughout February.</p>
<h3>Creators/Contributors</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/creators_contributors.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The creators/contributors fields have gotten a complete makeover that significantly reduces the clutter. We have optimized the new creators field for adding basic information (name/affiliation) as well as linking the affiliation field to vocabulary records (e.g. ROR). We postponed the more advanced use case of allowing the user to edit all fields such as identifier scheme and identifiers for affiliations, as this created an overly complex form for the majority of use cases.</p>
<p>The creator field we imagine can be extended in the future with support for importing authors via predefined files (e.g. BibTex, etc.).</p>
<p>One particular feature to highlight is that the name identifiers field now does automatic detection of the identifier scheme. You can now paste an ORCID (e.g. an ORCID URL), and the backend will automatically detect it as an ORCID and normalise the stored value.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/creators_names.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/coming_soon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have decided to hide certain fields that we know need further work. You'll see these as "Coming soon". Also, we have temporarily removed the language field from titles and descriptions as we had last minute issues with these fields.</p>
<h3>Minor UX Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sticky side bar: The side bar with the save/publish buttons, is now sticky so it will follow you when you scroll down the form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Resource type: The drop-down was reduced from two drop-downs to a single drop-down to reduce the number of needed clicks to select a resource type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete/discard button: There's now a delete button that you can use to delete your draft or discard edits to a published record.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Button consistency: We have applied consistent styling, wording and and naming to most buttons.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Errors for inline fields are now consistently displayed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Brand color: We have now made it easier to customize the styling of the field groups via a common brand color. Previously, if your header was purple, the field groups would remain blue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File warning: The warning displayed under the files section was updated to match Semantic UI styling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Field help text: We've added an example of field help text to the Dates field, which will expand to all fields needing it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Array fields styling: dates, related identifiers and titles are now properly using the entire form grid from side to side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/dates.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consistent naming of related work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Title: The deposit form now has a title.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Vocabularies: The vocabularies REST API received some significant backend changes, which means that we can now properly show translated text in auto-completion fields such as languages, license, affiliations, and subjects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extended Date Time Format indexing: We now have support for searching EDTF date ranges properly (contributed by TU Wien).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Geospatial indexing: We are now able to properly index almost any GeoJSON data type (points, boxes, polygons, etc.) so that they  can be searched properly at a later point. They are indexed via their centroid which is computed using the Shapely library (contributed by Cottage Labs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Core API methods needed for reindexing of vocabularies was added as well (contributed by EU JRC).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prettyprint: If you explore the REST API in a browser, you can now add <code>?prettyprint=1</code> to the URL, and the JSON will be nicely formatted for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discarding a change to an edited record doesn't work.</li>
<li>Licenses cannot be saved.</li>
<li>Languages cannot be saved and only Danish and English are currently available.</li>
<li>License data is missing.</li>
<li>Error messages at the top of the form are not displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>If you previously installed InvenioRDM, make sure you have the latest Docker image of your choice according to the Python version:</p>
<pre><code>docker pull inveniosoftware/centos7-python:3.6
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.7
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.8
</code></pre>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade invenio-cli
invenio-cli init rdm
cd my-site
invenio-cli containerize --pre
invenio-cli demo --containers
</code></pre>
<p>This month's version of invenio-cli is 0.21.0 .</p>
<p>To stop the instance without destroying the records that were created, you can just run:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-site
invenio-cli stop
</code></pre>
<p>To destroy the Python virtualenv, and remove the docker containers, you can now just run:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-site
invenio-cli destroy
</code></pre>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>As always, we welcome your feedback. When you provide feedback on Discourse your message should be pre-populated with the classic template (bugs, what worked well, what didn’t work well, wishes for documentation).</p>
<p>Here is the template to give feedback if it’s not automated:</p>

      <p>We’re excited to announce the InvenioRDM Alpha 14 (December release)! Thank you to our team members for their efforts on this release.</p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<h3>Vocabularies support</h3>
<p>The focus of the December release was to add support for linking bibliographic records with authority records such as subjects, grants, licenses, languages and more.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-complete on deposit fields</li>
<li>Facet searches based on vocabulary values</li>
<li>Support for internationalization on deposit, on facets, etc.</li>
<li>REST APIs for vocabularies</li>
<li>Linking of records in the backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deposit form autocompletion</h3>
<p>The most visible way to see the vocabularies in action is via the deposit form fields.</p>
<p>The below components were added in the deposit form and they support vocabulary autocompletion:</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>
<p>You can see the autocomplete search help:</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_0f6a4248b6ade70453232a3169a0be3e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And an example of i18n support, when the instance is in Turkish:</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_1162c1cc0d211cd2bb7e4eddde1480fd.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Licenses (preview)</strong></p>
<p>We have added support for both standard and custom licenses. Note that we were not able to fully complete this work, and there are known bugs in the license widget. Most notably you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search field does not allow spaces</li>
<li>Link not working</li>
<li>UX issues such as over-long page</li>
<li>Descriptions for licenses not available.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_a84cfafab881af6e3019e731bcb7f262.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Subjects (preview)</strong></p>
<p>The subjects field autocompletes from a subjects vocabulary that can host multiple different vocabularies at the same time.</p>
<p>The current version is not yet connected with the API, thus it has some demonstration values instead. Only the values you see in the image below can be selected. Don't save a record with subjects yet either.</p>

<h3>Invenio v3.4</h3>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of the December Invenio sprint, Invenio v3.4 was released (see more <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/2020-12-17-invenio-v340-released/">here</a>). The release of Invenio v3.4 was an important step for InvenioRDM. We now depend on stable releases of Semantic UI.</p>
<h3>Partial save and error reporting</h3>
<p>This release includes support for partial validation on draft creation. It also displays partial saves in the uploads page, for example with "No title" if the title was not included in the draft.</p>
<p>For example, saving an empty draft will tell you precisely what is missing at the top, along with pointers per field (see <code>title</code> at the bottom of the image).</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_39a402a38eaa38e8de0b11769e33b121.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The former error space will update to good (green) once you save a draft that is publication-ready. The publish button will then be enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_b2e7e415ece06d69c9026a1652452683.png" alt=""></p>

      <p>We are proud to announce the release of Invenio v3.4.0.</p>
<p>Head over to our <a href="/products/framework/">Getting started</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>Read the full <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/releases/v3.4.0.html">release notes</a>.</p>
<h1>What's new in Invenio v3.4?</h1>
<h2>New UI Framework: Semantic UI</h2>
<p>The largest new feature in Invenio v3.4 is the release of Semantic UI as the new UI framework. This works has been under way since we released version 3.0 with a deprecation notice on AngularJS 2.5 years ago.</p>
<p>Semantic UI is now the new default UI framework for Invenio, replacing the existing Bootstrap v3 framework. Most importantly, we have added support in Invenio v3.4 for supporting multiple UI frameworks concurrently. This means that Bootstrap 3 is still supported in v3.4 together with Semantic UI, and that we in the future can support new frameworks.</p>
<p>UI Frameworks evolve very rapidly and we expect that Invenio eventually will have to go through multiple UI frameworks over it’s life-time. Allowing support for multiple frameworks, isolate future changes, and even allow third-parties to develop custom themes for Invenio without impacting the business logic Invenio.</p>
<p>Technically the support for multiple UI frameworks works by having specialised Jinja template loading and themable webassets build systems.</p>
<p>Read more about the new system in <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/main-concepts/user-interface-styling.html#user-interface-styling">User interface styling</a>.</p>
<h2>Reorganised documentation</h2>
<p>We have reorganised the Invenio documentation, to make it easier for new developers to get started with Invenio.</p>
<p>In particular we now have a documentation overview page on <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/documentation/">https://inveniosoftware.org/documentation/</a> that gathers both Framework, RDM and ILS documentation under one umbrella.</p>
<p>We have also reorganised the main Invenio Framework documentation on <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></p>
<h3>Records improvements</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.4 marks the start of some larger improvements we want to make to the overall data flow for records in Invenio. With Invenio v3.4 we are releasing new features for Invenio-Records. These improvements are not being used by other Invenio modules yet, but allows us to ensure the backward compatibility of the changes.</p>
<p>Overall, the changes made to Invenio-Records focuses on having records stored in separate database tables/Elasticsearch indexes and making a simplified programmatic API that is less error prone to use.</p>
<p>The following only describes the new featuers at a high-level.</p>
<h4>Dumping/Loading support</h4>
<p>Records now supports dumping and loading of records. This will eventually replace the using signals for customising the JSON being indexed, as well as standardising the record being loaded from Elasticsearch, database or other sources.</p>
<h4>Type support</h4>
<p>Currently, a record only supports native JSON data types. In particular, date/time data types are not supported. We have now added the possiblity to support that certain fields inside your JSON have custom data types (such as datetime).</p>
<h4>Extensions</h4>
<p>We have added support record extensions as a mechanism for replacing signals. Overall the signals were causing issues, because you often needed signals per type of record you were dealing with. With the extensions, you can now more easily hook into</p>
<h4>System fields</h4>
<p>A typical issue you would deal with in Invenio is to create a record and a persistent identifier. System fields allows you to easily compose a record type with new features, so that e.g. <code>Record.create(...)</code> will also automatically create a persistent identifer.</p>
<h4>Backward compatibility</h4>
<p>All changes are backward compatible thus existing source code and stored records will continue to work with the latest release.</p>
<h3>Testing improvements</h3>
<h4>GitHub Actions instead of Travis CI</h4>
<p>We have moved almost all our 100+ repositories from using Travis CI as the continues integration system to GitHub Actions. This was due to Travis CI imposing a migration from .org to .com and lowering the total number of resources availble for open source projects. Overall, this meant very long waiting times for pull-request builds as well as PyPI releases. We have therefore migration to GitHub Actions. We would like to thank Travis CI for the service they have provided through out the years to the open source community.</p>
<h4>Reprodicible tests</h4>
<p>We have developed a new tool <a href="http://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-services-cli">Docker-Services-CLI</a>, that helps bring up/down required services such as databases, Elasticsearch, etc for testing. This makes it easier to investigate specific test failures locally, as well as making it easier to migrate between continuous integration systems.</p>
<h4>Centralised test dependencies and Pytest-Invenio</h4>
<p>With the release of Pytest-Invenio v1.4 we have centralised test dependencies to a single module, and can more easily control breaking changes from third-party packages. Previously new version of isort and pytest have been causing wide-spread test failures due to minor changes.</p>
<h1>Minor changes in v3.4</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Invenio-Accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password length validation during login was removed.</li>
<li>"Log in" instead of "Sign in" is now being used consistently throughout the application. Previously both version could be found.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-App:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>/ping</code> endpoint (used by e.g. load balancers for aliveness checks) now also supports <code>HEAD</code> and <code>OPTIONS</code> HTTP verbs as recommended by e.g. HAProxy documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-Celery</p>
<ul>
<li>Only Celery to 4.4.x to 5.0.x releases are supported. Note, Celery have declared Celery 4.4.x as a Long Term Support release. Note, that Celery changed command line arguments from <code>celery worker -A &lt;app&gt;</code> to <code>celery -A &lt;app&gt; worker</code> between version 4 and 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-DB</p>
<ul>
<li>Now support SQLAlchemy &lt;1.4 which include e.g. PostgreSQL 12 support.</li>
<li>Hides the database password from CLI output when running <code>db init</code> or <code>db create</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-Indexer</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch delete requests now uses optimistic concurrency control by providing the the <code>version</code> and <code>version_type</code> in delete requests. The previous behavior can restored by calling <code>RecordIndexer().delete(record, version=None, version_type=None)</code> instead. This fixes an issue where deleting and recreating a document right after would fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Invenio-JSONSchemas</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue related to nested <code>allOf</code> being ignored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-OAuthClient</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for CERN OpenID contrib.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invenio-Records-REST</p>
<ul>
<li>The header <code>Cache-Control: 'no-cache'</code> is now sent on successful HTTP 200 responses to ensure that browsers will not cache responses client side and ETag will be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Invenio-REST</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes a bug with CSRF checking when the endpoint did not exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Deprecations in v3.4</h1>
<h2>Bootstrap 3</h2>
<p>Bootstrap v3 has reached end-of-life and will no longer receive further updates from their maintainers. Migrating to Bootstrap v4 or v5 is as difficult as upgrading to Semantic UI and there are no easy migration paths.</p>
<p>We will continue to support the Bootstrap v3 integration throughout the maintenance period of Invenio v3.4. Invenio v3.5 <em>may</em> move all Bootstrap 3 templates to a separate Invenio package, that you could install, however v3.5 will not add new Bootstrap 3 templates.</p>
<p><strong>You should plan allocating time for a migration from Bootstrap 3 to Semantic UI during 2021</strong></p>
<h1>Features removed in v3.4</h1>
<h3>Elasticsearch v2 and v5 support</h3>
<p>We have removed support for Elasticsearch v2 and v5 as announced in v3.3. Elasticsearch v2 and v5 have reached end-of-life and is no longer maintained with security fixes, thus you should strongly consider upgrading in case you have not already done so.</p>
<h3>AMD/RequireJS</h3>
<p>The old AMD/RequireJS assets build system, that was deprecated and replaced with Webpack in Invenio v3.1 has now been completely removed from the code base.</p>
<h1>Maintenance policy</h1>
<p>Invenio v3.4 will be supported with bug and security fixes until the release of Invenio v3.6 and minimum until 2021-12-17.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/maintenance-policy.html">Maintenance Policy</a>.</p>

    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>On 17 and 24 November 2020 the InvenioRDM project partners met in two telecons to discuss the <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/">Metadata Reference</a> document.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-12-15-metadata/metadata_reference.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These conversations were a follow-up to the community's review of the document. Feedback and questions were collected in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djBrPMaeVH4IlpFADMJSpgd5JJ1xIiPY5GwLs87Wwjw/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a> prior to the conversations. The conversations helped to confirm many answers to questions about the data model that had been posed in the Doc, such as: whether ‘role’ is required for Creators (no - only for Contributors), are Resource Types customizable (yes), and which file is shown in the previewer when a record has multiple files (the first, unless otherwise specified). See the Doc for responses to additional questions.</p>
<p><strong>Use Cases Requested</strong></p>
<p>For some fields, further feedback is needed in order to make them as useful for the community as possible. In particular, your <code>use cases</code> are requested for the following scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a Language tag to Titles</li>
<li>Records with more than one Publisher (making Publisher a repeatable field)</li>
<li>Having a built-in “Unknown” option for Contributor type and/or role</li>
<li>Having more than one Identifier per Affiliation</li>
</ol>
<p>Please post your use cases back to the top of the original <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djBrPMaeVH4IlpFADMJSpgd5JJ1xIiPY5GwLs87Wwjw/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a> or to the new Metadata Interest Group topic at: <a href="https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch">https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch</a> (more on this below).</p>
<p><strong>Subjects</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the topic of Subjects was brought up for further discussion. The Subjects example in the Metadata Reference document shows the incorporation of one controlled vocabulary, the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html">Medical Subject Headings</a>, into the schema.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-12-15-metadata/subjects_mesh.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, there are many controlled vocabularies that we can potentially map to the Subjects field. Which will be most useful to incorporate for the wider community, and what are potential use cases?</p>
<p>This is one of the first issues we would like to discuss in the Metadata Interest Group, which is set to launch in January 2021. This group welcomes the contributions and insights of developers, users, administrators, decision-makers, and anyone else at participating organizations with metadata experience, interest, and insights. Through the end of 2020 we will work to publicize the group and recruit members. If you’re interested in joining, please either sign up here: <a href="https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/metadata-interest-group/144">https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/t/metadata-interest-group/144</a> or DM me on Discord (see the Welcome channel).</p>
<p><strong>Community Outreach</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to serving the entire InvenioRDM community as our family of adopters continues to grow and thrive. This is the first, we hope, of many blog posts that will address topics of interest to the community at large, including developers, administrators, curators, and decision-makers. If there is a topic you would like us to explore, or perhaps even contribute a post on yourself, we’d like to know. If the topic would be best covered at a community-focused telecon (also on the horizon for the coming months!), we’d like to know that as well. Please contribute any and all ideas at my contact listed above.</p>
<p>Take care and stay safe!</p>

      <p>We’re excited to announce the InvenioRDM Alpha 13 (November release)!</p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<h3>Files support</h3>
<p>It is now possible to upload files on the draft form and publish them.</p>
<h4>File uploader</h4>
<p>When creating a new draft, you can now also upload files that will be included in the published record. The file uploader supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag-n-dropping files to be uploaded</li>
<li>Concurrent uploads (by default up to 4)</li>
<li>Setting the default preview file</li>
<li>Completely disabling files to allow for metadata-only records</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-29-november-release/file-upload.gif" alt=""></p>
<h4>New REST API</h4>
<p>Big part of our efforts went into designing a new files REST API that will allow InvenioRDM to easily support upload workflows depending on third-party storage systems (e.g S3).</p>
<p>You can check out the documentation of these endpoints in our newly added <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/rest_api/">REST API reference</a>.</p>
<h4>Files listing and preview</h4>
<p>Uploaded files are also listed and can be previewed on the record's landing page, using a variety of extensible previewers. We currently support preview of PDFs, images, ZIP files, CSV tables, and some text-based formats like XML, JSON, and Markdown.</p>
<p>By default, files are listed in alphabetical order and the first previewable file is shown in the preview box. You can specifically set which file you want to be by default previewed in the record's draft form.</p>
<h3>Reorganized CLI commands</h3>
<p>Thanks to the community's feedback, in this release we have also updated the existing CLI commands, with the goal of improving the development and operational workflows of an InvenioRDM instance. Our newly added <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/cli/">CLI reference documentation</a> lists and describes in detail the command groups, their sub-commands, and the options they support.</p>
<p>Make sure to go through our documentation, since many old commands have now new options and different default behavior (e.g. service setup will now also create demo records).</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>As always, we welcome your feedback. When you provide feedback on Discourse your message should be pre-populated with the classic template (bugs, what worked well, what didn’t work well, wishes for documentation).</p>
<p>Here is the template to give feedback if it’s not automated:</p>

    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>We're happy to announce the InvenioRDM October release. Thank you to our team members for their efforts on this release.</p>
<p>In early October we held a virtual project workshop. As part of the workshop we have updated the roadmap. The roadmap is now publicly available in two versions, one simplified and one for project tracking. See below:</p>
<p>1- <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/roadmap/">Simplified</a></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/roadmap_simplified.png" alt=""></p>
<p>2- <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/milestones?direction=asc&amp;sort=due_date&amp;state=open">GitHub for project tracking</a></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/roadmap_tracking.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>What's new?</h3>
<h4>Metadata Schema</h4>
<p>The entire metadata schema for bibliographic records has been updated, and is now ready for a thorough review by all project partners. The update includes changes to the JSONSchema, Elasticsearch mappings, the REST API data validation layer as well as addition of many fields to the deposit form.</p>
<p>See (<a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/">https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/</a>) for for a full reference of the new metadata schema.</p>
<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>We have done a lot of work on improving the UX of the primary pages such as the frontpage, search results and record landing page. Below you can see some screenshots of before/after:</p>
<p><strong>Search results</strong></p>
<p>The search results have been tightened up as well. Also, we’ve added support for nested facets, so you can expand broader categories into subcategories (e.g., Publication and Image).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/search_before_after.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Landing page</strong></p>
<p>The landing page you’ll notice now has Edit and New version buttons (only the Edit button currently works). The right column has been tightened up, and most of the new metadata fields are now properly displayed on the landing page.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/landing_before_after.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Human readable labels</strong></p>
<p>In the facets you’ll notice we now have human readable labels. Instead of 'publication' it will say 'Publication'; instead of 'open' it will say 'Open Access'.</p>
<p>Similarly to search results and landing pages, you’ll now see the correct resource type as well as icons on Open Access.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/badges.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Localization</strong></p>
<p>Dates, like the publication date which supports Extended Date Time Format is now properly localized as well using the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. For instance here an English and Turkish localization:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/localization_english.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/localization_turkish.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Affiliations</strong></p>
<p>The affiliation display was redone:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/affiliations.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Manage section</strong></p>
<p>There’s a new manage section on the record landing page, which allows you to edit a record.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-11-11-october-release/manage.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>CLI Improvements</h4>
<p>We have made it easier to get started with developing InvenioRDM. Partially to make our own developers' life easier, but also to make it easier to customize InvenioRDM.</p>
<p><strong>Shells</strong></p>
<p>You can now easily activate the Python virtualenv shell as well start a Python terminal from your instance using the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">invenio-cli shell
invenio-cli pyshell
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Watching assets</strong></p>
<p>We have now simplified how you can change styling via automatic watching of file changes on assets. Previously you had to manually rebuild the assets. Now instead you can simply execute the following commands, and the styling will automatically rebuild once the file changes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">invenio-cli assets --force --development
invenio-cli assets watch
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Develop an Invenio module</strong></p>
<p>Developers often need to install the latest development versions of Invenio modules to work on them. This can now easily be done with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">invenio-cli ext module-install ~/src/invenio-app-rdm ~/src/invenio-rdm-records
invenio-cli assets --force --development
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Develop a React module</strong></p>
<p>The above works only for Python packages. If instead, you are working on one of our React libraries, you can now easily install and watch the module for changes as well:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">invenio-cli assets watch-module --link ~/src/react-invenio-deposit
</code></pre>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>If you previously installed InvenioRDM, make sure you have the latest Docker image of your choice according to the Python version:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">docker pull inveniosoftware/centos7-python:3.6
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.7
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.8
</code></pre>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">pip install --upgrade invenio-cli
invenio-cli init rdm
cd my-site
invenio-cli containerize --pre
invenio-cli demo --containers
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the instance without destroying the records that were created, you can just run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">cd my-site
invenio-cli stop
</code></pre>
<p>To destroy the Python virtualenv, and remove the docker containers, you can now just run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">cd my-site
invenio-cli destroy
</code></pre>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>As always, we welcome your feedback. When you provide feedback on Discourse your message should be pre-populated with the classic template (bugs, what worked well, what didn’t work well, wishes for documentation).</p>
<p>Here is the template to give feedback if it’s not automated:</p>

      <p>We are glad to announce InvenioRDM Alpha 11 (September release)!</p>
<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>We now have support for drafts, meaning you can now start a deposit, save it, and come back many days later to publish it.</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_2a5637ca669df53e811eac65b690f4f0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This simple change marks a very big milestone for the backend of InvenioRDM. During the past months we have been revamping the entire data and control flow of the backend. The flow is what is supporting the core of InvenioRDM - submitting, editing and searching for records - and it determines what is possible and what's not possible in InvenioRDM. These changes enable the customizations needed by partners including customizations to permissions, publishing workflows, metadata fields, indexing and serializations just to name a few.</p>
<p>A high-level overview of the new flow is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-10-12-september-release/status_platform.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This new flow is implemented in the following Invenio modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/flask-resources">Flask-Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-records-resources">Invenio-Records-Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources">Invenio-Drafts-Resources</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Install (TL;DR)</h3>
<p>If you previously installed InvenioRDM, make sure you have the latest Docker image of your choice according to the Python version:</p>
<pre><code>docker pull inveniosoftware/centos7-python:3.6
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.7
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.8
</code></pre>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade invenio-cli
invenio-cli init rdm
cd my-site
invenio-cli containerize --pre
invenio-cli demo --containers
</code></pre>
<p>To destroy the Python virtualenv, and remove the docker containers, you can now just run:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-site
invenio-cli destroy
</code></pre>
<p>It's the first feature by Rodrigo Almeida, the newest addition to our team!</p>
