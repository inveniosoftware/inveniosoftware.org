      <p>Two CERN sprint teams with a total of 14 developers have just each finished a two-week sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint team 1: Focused on the Invenio v3.2 release which will include the new  Files bundle.</li>
<li>Sprint team 2: Focused on adding Elasticsearch 7 support as well prepare  the Invenio v3.3 release which will include the new index migration utilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>A total of 23 new module releases where made during the sprint.  The highlights from the two sprints include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch 7 support.</li>
<li>Elasticsearch index prefixing and suffixing support for shared clusters (this is needed for the upcoming index migrator utilities).</li>
<li>Marshmallow v2 and v3 compatibility. Invenio is now able to accept both Marshmallow v2 and v3 schemas. In your Invenio instance you will need to pin the Marshmallow version that matches your schemas, and follow the upgrade guide provided by Marshmallow to upgrade your schemas.</li>
<li>Sentry support is now using the Sentry-Python library instead of Raven library (you can still switch back to Raven by setting <code>SENTRY_SDK = False</code> in your configuration).</li>
<li>Rate limiting now differentiates between guests and authenticated users, and allows for external modules to provide per user rate limits.</li>
<li>Improved HTML sanitisation support in several modules.</li>
<li>Improved support for client-side infinite scroll in the REST API.</li>
<li>Housekeeping: we have fixed a significant number of  build failures as well as deprecation warnings from other libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of above highlights will be released together with Invenio v3.2. Most of the individual modules have already been released, however you are still on your own if you decide to go head with them prior to the Invenio v3.2 release (if you encounter problems, we are of course very interested in hearing about it, so that we can solve them before the v3.2 release).</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<h3>Invenio v3.2 and Files Bundle</h3>
<p>The primary focus is still to release Invenio v3.2. The  pending issues are limited to final testing and documentation.</p>
<h3>Elasticsearch v2 and v5 deprecation</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.3 will add index migration utilities that will allow Invenio users to   upgrade their Elasticsearch clusters to supported Elasticsearch versions. In Invenio v3.4 we plan to then remove support for Elasticsearch v2 and v5.</p>
<h3>Python v2 support ends January 1st 2020.</h3>
<p>Python v2.7 will reach end of life on January 1st, 2020. Invenio will only support Python 2.7 until that date. From January 1st, 2020 we will remove Python 2.7 from our test matrixes, and thus new module releases after January 1st 2020 will very likely no longer work on Python 2.7.</p>
<p>We are already seeing a large number of our dependent Python libraries that have removed Python 2 support, and thus we will not be able to continue Python 2 support beyond January 1st, 2020.</p>
<h3>Invenio v3.3 - Index migration and usage statistics</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.3 is planned for release in late 2019 or early 2020.  The primary focus for Invenio v3.3 will be adding support for Elasticsearch index migration as well as releasing the Statistics Bundle (COUNTER-compliant usage statistics). The Statistics Bundle includes the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio-Stats</li>
<li>Invenio-Queues</li>
<li>COUNTER-Robots</li>
</ul>
<p>Invenio v3.3 may also see the release of a new module, Invenio-Records-Permissions, which will significantly simplify the defining and managing access control for records.</p>

      <p>Two vulnerabilities have been identified in <em>supported</em> Invenio modules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invenio-Records</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-records/security/advisories/GHSA-vxh3-mvv7-265j">security advisory</a>): A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Invenio-Records in the administration interface.</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-App</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app/security/advisories/GHSA-94mf-xfg5-r247">security advisory</a>): A Host header injection vulnerability has been identified in Invenio-App.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two XSS vulnerabilities have been discovered in <em>unsupported</em> Invenio modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invenio-Previewer</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-previewer/security/advisories/GHSA-j9m2-6hq2-4r3c">security advisory</a>): An XSS vulnerability affecting the JSON, Markdown and iPython Notebook previewers.</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-Communities</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/security/advisories/GHSA-mfv8-q39f-mgfg">security advisory</a>): An XSS vulnerability affecting the Jinja templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vulnerabilities were found after an XSS vulnerability was reported to Zenodo by Ciro Santilli. As a standard measure and after patching Zenodo, we reviewed the Invenio source code for potential similar issues to those identified in the Zenodo source code. This led to the discovery of three additional XSS vulnerabilities. The host header injection vulnerability was discovered after a standard vulnerability scan of another service running at CERN.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>We have issued two new Invenio releases fixing these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio v3.0.2 and v3.1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>The following individual modules fixing the vulnerabilities have been released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invenio-Records v1.0.2, v1.1.1 and v1.2.2</li>
<li>Invenio-App v1.0.6 and v1.1.1</li>
<li>Invenio-Previewer v1.0.0a12 (unsupported)</li>
<li>Invenio-Communities v1.0.0a20 (unsupported)</li>
</ul>
<h3>New security policy</h3>
<p>We have taken the chance during handling of these vulnerabilities to also clearly define and document Invenio's <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/security-policy.html">security policy</a>. Please have a look and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Previously, we have sometimes privately notified potentially affected services about a security vulnerability. We have however decided to discontinue this practice, and instead, send out an advance notification to everyone about an upcoming security release including only the severity level of the issue. This allows everyone to plan ahead for the upcoming release and ensure they have staff available to handle the release. This partially smoothens the communication process but also ensures that everyone receives the same information in a scalable approach.</p>
<h3>GitHub security advisors</h3>
<p>As a new thing, we have also evaluated the new GitHub <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories">maintainer security advisories</a> to handle the vulnerabilities. These advisories are reviewed by GitHub and should allow a security alert to be sent to affected repositories.</p>

      <p><strong>In our latest Invenio sprint from May 13-24 we've been working on making Elasticsearch upgrades, migration and reindexing simpler and with near zero downtime. Read on, to learn more about how you keep up with Elasticsearch rapid release and deprecation cycles with Invenio and for a preview of what will come of new features in Invenio v3.2.</strong></p>
<h2>End of life</h2>
<p>Once you start running a production Invenio instance, you'll quickly notice that your Elasticsearch cluster will become outdated pretty fast, due to Elasticsearch's rapid release and deprecation cycle. Invenio v3 development was started in 2016 against the newly released Elasticsearch v2. When Invenio v3 was finally released in June 2018, Elasticsearch has had two major releases (v5 and v6) and v2 had already reached end of life. As can be seen from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/support/eol">Elastic Product End of Life Dates</a>, you can expect a major Elasticsearch version to be supported for a maximum of 2-3 years. Thus, you should plan to regularly upgrade your Elasticsearch cluster in order to not run on unmaintained software.</p>
<h2>Index upgrades with downtime</h2>
<p>Elasticsearch allows an index created in v5 to be read in v6 which combined with rolling cluster upgrades allows you to upgrade a cluster relatively easy with no downtime. However, you are out of luck as soon as you want to upgrade again from v6 to v7 since v7 cannot read an index created in v5.</p>
<p>The solution is for every major Elasticsearch upgrade to create a new index and reindex content from your old index. This requires you to take offline your Invenio instance to avoid that new content is indexed during the reindexing process. For large-scale production systems with many millions of records, reindexing can take a long time, and thus might require several hours of downtime, which can quickly be a big issue these systems.</p>
<h2>Fixing Elasticsearch mappings</h2>
<p>A related problem you may hit when running an Invenio instance is that you would like to tweak the Elasticsearch mappings in order to improve search performance and precision. In Elasticsearch you cannot modify the mapping of an existing index, thus similar to above, you need to create a new index and reindex content from the old index.</p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>All in all, you'll find yourself in need of tools to manage indexes and performing reindexing in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade an Elasticsearch cluster between major versions.</li>
<li>Migrate between two Elasticsearch clusters.</li>
<li>Change Elasticsearch mappings of existing indexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Near-zero downtime upgrade, migration and reindexing</h2>
<p>To solve the above use cases, we've built a new Invenio module named <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-index-migrator">Invenio-Index-Migrator</a>. The module allows you to synchronize two Elasticsearch indexes (in-cluster or cross-cluster) over an extended time period, and when you are ready, you can roll over the new index. Depending on how you have deployed Invenio, the rollover can happen with either zero downtime or near zero downtime (&lt;5 minutes compared to hours)</p>
<p>The new module supports migrating records but also any other index you may have in Elasticsearch such as event logging from usage statistics. The new module works by defining <strong>migration recipes</strong> and managing them via a CLI</p>
<h4>Demo</h4>
<p><em>Disclaimer: APIs etc may change slightly before the final release.</em></p>
<p>First, you initialize a migration recipe (here a recipe named <code>records</code>) which will create new indexes to hold the new data:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration init "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Next, you kick-off the index migration:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration run "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Index migration happens in two stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulk migration:</strong> First a snapshot of the current index is reindexing into the new index. Invenio-Index-Migrator is flexible an supports several methods. By default, we use the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html">Elasticsearch Reindex API</a> which in most cases are orders of magnitudes faster than any other method. Other methods allow you to use Invenio's default record indexing or simply implement your own.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Once the first snapshot has been fully indexed, a second job is started to keep the two indexes in sync. Essentially this works by indexing any modifications to the old index in the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any point during the migration, you can check the status:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration status "records"
</code></pre>
<p>Once you're ready, you can roll over the new index:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration rollover "records"
</code></pre>
<p>In an in-cluster migration, the rollover works by shuffling around index aliases (since Elasticsearch does not support renaming indexes). In a cross-cluster migration you update the Invenio configuration to point to your new Elasticsearch cluster.</p>
<p>In case something goes wrong during the index migration, you can of course also cancel the job:</p>
<pre><code>$ invenio index migration cancel "records"

<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>During the sprint a number of other issues were addressed that will also be part of Invenio v3.2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch v7 support</strong> was added to Invenio-Search, Invenio-Indexer and Invenio-Records-REST. Only Invenio-OAIServer needs to be upgraded to support Elasticsearch 7.</li>
<li><strong>Search index prefixing</strong> allowing multiple Invenio instances to use the same Elasticsearch cluster. Elasticsearch by default does not support the concept of virtual hosts. With search indexing prefixing, it will be possible to use a single Elasticsearch cluster for multiple Invenio instances, given that the Invenio instances either trust each other, or you have a protection-layer like Elastic X-Pack or ReadonlyREST in front of Elasticsearch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The Invenio-Index-Migrator is only the first building blocks in order to make Elasticsearch upgrades, migration and reindexing simple. We hope to add assistant-like features that will make it even easier to keep with the latest Elasticsearch releases.</p>
<p>The Invenio-Index-Migrator will be finally released with Invenio v3.2 which is planned for July-September.</p>

      <p><strong>CERN has partnered with 10 multidisciplinary institutions and companies to build a turn-key open source research data management platform called InvenioRDM, and grow a diverse community to sustain the platform.</strong></p>
<p>The InvenioRDM project is funded by the <a href="https://kt.cern">CERN Knowledge Transfer Fund</a>, as well as all the participating partners,  including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bnl.gov">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu">Caltech Library</a> (US)</li>

<li><a href="https://www.hzdr.de">Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a> (DE)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> (US)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE</a> (GR)</li>
<li><a href="https://tind.io">TIND</a> (NO)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tubitak.gov.tr">Tubitak</a> (TK)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uni-hamburg.de">University of Hamburg</a> (DE)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/">University of Münster</a> (DE)</li>
</ul>
<p>The project has an ambitious one year schedule in which it will deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>InvenioRDM - A research data management platform based on <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> and <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org">Invenio v3 Framework</a>.</li>
<li>A community of public and private institutions to sustain InvenioRDM.</li>
<li>Minimum two existing repositories migrated to InvenioRDM, with Zenodo being one of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to successfully achieving the ambitious schedule is that InvenioRDM will be based on Zenodo that have already been successfully validated over the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Our vision in the next five-years, is to make InvenioRDM a world-leading extensible research data management platform used by research institutions all around the world and with businesses providing services, support and customizations on top of InvenioRDM.</p>
<h1>What is a RDM platform?</h1>
<p>An research data management (RDM) platform allows researchers to share and preserve scientific results. Researchers can share anything from publications, posters, presentations to datasets and software. Once a researcher have shared a result, they get a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), that allow them to properly cite their result.</p>
<p>There are three primary purposes of RDM is to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disseminate and archive</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable reproducibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable reuse</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, research funding agencies all over the world have realised the huge potential economic and social benefits of RDM to society and are now demanding solutions.</p>
<h1>Zenodo</h1>
<p><a href="http://home.cern">CERN</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE</a> has built one such RDM service with European Union funding called <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>. Zenodo has been highly successful and has in its 5 years of existence become a world-leading general purpose research data repositories.</p>
<p>In fact, other institutions have already taken Zenodo source code (which is open source), and started building their own local RDM solutions on it. The goal of this project is to join our efforts to build a common RDM-platform from which both CERN, other institutions and private businesses can profit.</p>
<h1>Multidisciplinary partners</h1>
<p>The real strength of the project is that it brings together a suite of partners from multidisciplinary domains, that each bring unique knowledge and know-how from their specific domains that will be critical to the success of project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional partners:<ul>
<li>University of Hamburg</li>
<li>University of Münster</li>
<li>Caltech Library</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health and medical science partners:<ul>
<li>Northwestern University</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics partners:<ul>
<li>Helmholz Zentrum Dreseden Rossendorf</li>
<li>Brookhaven National Laboratory</li>
<li>TUBITAK - The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Digital humanities partners:<ul>
<li>Data Futures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business partners:<ul>
<li>TIND Technologies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community partners:<ul>
<li>OpenAIRE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Building InvenioRDM</h1>
<p>InvenioRDM will include most of the features that Zenodo alreday include today such as e.g. DOI miniting capabilities, versioning support and COUNTER compliant usage statistics to name some few.</p>
<p>The work in transforming Zenodo into a general purpose RDM-platform will involve three key areas:</p>
<p><strong>Core repository</strong></p>
<p>The repository platform will at its core include an extensible metadata model based DataCite metadata schema with support for handling millions of records and peta bytes of data. The repository will further be aligned with the <a href="http://ngr.coar-repositories.org">Next Generation Repositories</a> (NGR) standard.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging and distribution</strong></p>
<p>Key for easy adoption of InvenioRDM is to ensure that it is a real turn-key solution requiring minimal experience in installing, operating and administering the platform, or in short getting users started in no time. Thus, a significant part of the efforts will go into simplifing the installation, improving the packaging and distribution, as well as providing excellent end-user documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Customization and extendability</strong></p>
<p>A key requirement for InvenioRDM is that it can easily be extended and customized just enough to adapt to each particular institution. This includes for instance defining authentication mechanisms (SAML/LDAP/OAuth), integrating with mutliple storage backend system, and most important of all to make these customizations easy.</p>

<p>The Invenio v3 Bootcamp was held from the 19th to the 21st of March, 2019 at CERN. The event reached the maximum number of 30 participants with attendees from all over the world (Czech Republic, Danmark, Germany, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, UK and USA).
The bootcamp was targeting developers wanting to learn more about Invenio and to understand how to create or customize an Invenio repository.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>The three days of the bootcamp was organised with a succession of talks and practical hands-on sessions, presented by 6 Invenio experts. Participants were able to develop each of the functionality on their laptop with a constant assistant in case of need.</p>
<p>The objective was to discover the Invenio framework and acquire knowledge on how to build a new repository by progressively introducing new concepts.</p>
<p>The main topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started with Invenio</li>
<li>Tour of functionalities and infrastructure</li>
<li>Customizations of data models and look &amp; feel</li>
<li>Deposit of new records and references between data models</li>
<li>Access control</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Deployment and application architecture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try it yourself</strong></p>
<p>We've made all the material publicly available for all those who couldn't participate in the event, so you can try out the same exercises at home:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/training">Training exercises</a></li>
<li><a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/773969/timetable/#all">Presentations on the event website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you run into troubles, we're happy to <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/getting-help.html">answer questions</a> you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>Participants had the opportunity to experience how to work with Invenio thanks to the hands-on sessions and to understand how to apply each of the introduced functionalities to use cases of their organization.</p>
<p>The bootcamp attracted quite a lot of interest for Invenio and participants were very involved and curious: we were very glad to answer to all of the interesting questions that were asked.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone for their participation and help to have contributed​ to the success of the event.</p>
<p><strong>Invenio User Group Workshop 2019 @ Open Repositories 2019, June 10th</strong></p>

      <p>We are proud to announce the release of Invenio v3.1.0.</p>
<p>Head over to our <a href="/gettingstarted/">Getting started</a> to see it in action.</p>
<h3>Python compatibility</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.1 supports Python 2.7 (until 2019-12-31), Python 3.5 and Python 3.6. We expect to add support for Python 3.7 in the near-term future once Celery v4.3 has been released.</p>
<h1>What's new in Invenio v3.1?</h1>
<h2>Webpack build system</h2>
<p>Invenio v3.1 comes with a new assets build system based on Webpack for building and packaging your JavaScript applications, stylesheets and much more. The system replaces the previous AMD/RequireJS based system which was deprecated in v3.0.</p>
<p>The old build system is still available to allow users to upgrade to Invenio v3.1 without first migrating to Webpack. The old build system will be removed in Invenio v3.3</p>
<p>For more information about the new build system, please see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://invenio-assets.readthedocs.io/">Invenio-Assets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://invenio-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html">Upgrade to Webpack</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Simplified scaffolding</h2>
<p>We have simplified the scaffolding of new Invenio instance by merging the data model template into the main Cookiecutter-Invenio-Instance.</p>
<p>The previous approach of two separate packages -- one for the application and one for the data model -- caused friction and confusion for new users and we, therefore, decided to merge both.</p>
<p>This also fits with our <em>long-term</em> goal, where we want to provide standard data models (such as DataCite, Dublin Core, MARC21) so that users don't have write their own data model.</p>
<h4>Docker base image</h4>
<p>We have released a new Docker image that can serve as base image for your Invenio instances. The image is based on CentOS 7 and comes with Python 3.6, Node.JS, NPM and some standard libraries often needed by Invenio.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cloud.docker.com/u/inveniosoftware/repository/docker/inveniosoftware/centos7-python">inveniosoftware/centos7-python</a> on DockerHub.</p>
<h4>Pipenv</h4>
<p>In order to manage Python dependencies more reliable and securely for your Invenio instance we have moved to use <a href="http://pipenv.readthedocs.io">Pipenv</a> which also handles the virtualenv creation. This has all been integrated with the <a href="/gettingstarted/">Getting started</a> guide.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>New sections where added to the documentation specifically on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundles</li>
<li>Requirements</li>
<li>Build a repository</li>
<li>Managing access</li>
<li>Secure your instance</li>
<li>Infrastructure architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://invenio.readthedocs.io">https://invenio.readthedocs.io</a>.</p>
<h2>Request tracing</h2>
<p>Invenio v3.1 has added new features for improved request tracing to allow for better troubleshooting and auditing of problems. The feature allows logging a request id, session id and user id across multiple services such as Nginx and Invenio error logs. This enables e.g. system administrators to identify exactly which Nginx access log line caused a specific error logged by Invenio.</p>
<p>If combined with e.g. centralised log aggregation, this can be used for e.g. viewing requests by a user in real-time, request performance statistics and many other metrics. Please note that in order to be compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you must ensure that these logs are automatically deleted after 3 months (the same is the case if you only log an IP address).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookiecutter-Invenio-Instance</strong>:<ul>
<li>Nginx configuration has been updated to automatically generate a random
request id and add is as <code>X-Request-ID</code> header.</li>
<li>Nginx log format has been updated to log timing information, request id,
session id and user id if provided by the application server in the
<code>X-Session-ID</code> and <code>X-User-ID</code> HTTP headers. Nginx will remove both
headers prior to sending the response to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-App</strong>:<ul>
<li>Extracts the <code>X-Request-ID</code> header (max 200 chars) if set in the HTTP
request and makes it available on the Flask <code>g</code> object as
<code>g.request_id</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-Logging</strong>:<ul>
<li>The request id is made available to all log handlers.</li>
<li>The Sentry log handler will add the request ID as a tag if available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Invenio-Accounts</strong><ul>
<li>The <code>X-Session-ID</code> and <code>X-User-ID</code> HTTP headers will be added to the
HTTP repsponse if the configuration variable
<code>ACCOUNTS_USERINFO_HEADERS</code> is set to <code>True</code>. This makes the session
and user id available to upstream servers like Nginx.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Minor changes in v3.1</h1>
<h4>Token expiration</h4>
<p>The token expiration was changed from 5 days to 30 minutes for the password reset token and email confirmation token. Using the tokens will as a side-effect login in the user, which means that if the link is leaked (e.g. forwarded by the users themselves), then another person can use the link to access the account. Flask-Security v3.1.0 addresses this issue, but has not yet been released.</p>
<h4>Globus.org OAuth Login</h4>
<p>Invenio v3.1 now comes with support for login with your Globus.org account. The feature was contributed by University of Chicago.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://invenio-oauthclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#module-invenio_oauthclient.contrib.globus">Invenio-OAuthClient</a> for details.</p>
<h4>Health-check view</h4>
<p>A <code>/ping</code> view that can be enabled via the <code>APP_HEALTH_BLUEPRINT_ENABLED</code> configuration variable has been added to support load balancers like HAProxy to check if the application server is responsive.</p>
<h1>Backwards incompatible changes</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pytest-Invenio:</strong> The <code>celery_config</code> fixture has been renamed to <code>celery_config_ext</code> due to naming conflict with fixture provided by Celery.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Deprecations in v3.1</h1>
<p>Following list of features have been deprecated and will be removed in either
Invenio v3.2 or Invenio v3.3:</p>
<h2>Elasticsearch v2 support</h2>
<p>Elasticsearch v2 support will be removed in Invenio v3.2. Elasticsearch v2 has reached end of life and no longer receives any bug or security fixes.</p>
<p>Both the support in Invenio-Search for creating indexes for v2 as well as any v2 Elasticsearch mappings in other Invenio modules will be removed.</p>
<h2>AMD/RequireJS</h2>
<p>Invenio's assets build system based on AMD/RequireJS will be removed in Invenio v3.3.</p>
<p>This involves e.g. the two CLI commands:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ invenio npm
$ invenio assets build
</code></pre>
<p>Several Python modules in Invenio-Assets will be removed, including (but not
limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invenio_assets.npm</code></li>
<li><code>invenio_assets.filters</code></li>
<li><code>invenio_assets.glob</code></li>
<li><code>invenio_assets.proxies</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, bundle definitions in other Invenio modules will be removed. These are
usually located in <code>bundles.py</code> files, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invenio_theme.bundles</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, some static files will be removed from bundles, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invenio_theme/static/js/*</code></li>
<li><code>invenio_theme/static/scss/*</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>DynamicPermission class</h2>
<p>The <code>invenio_access.DynamicPermission</code> class will be removed in Invenio v3.2. It has been superseded by the <code>invenio_access.Permission</code> class. The <code>Permission</code> class by default deny an action in case no user/role is assigned. The <code>DynamicPermission</code> instead allowed an action if no user/role was assigned.</p>
<h2>Records CLI</h2>
<p>The following CLI commands will be removed in Invenio v3.2:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ invenio records create
$ invenio records delete
$ invenio records patch
</code></pre>
<p>Please use the REST API instead to create, patch and delete records.</p>
<h2>AngularJS (reminder from v3.0)</h2>
<p>In Invenio v3.0 we deprecated the AngularJS 1.4 application Invenio-Search-JS as AngularJS by that time was already outdated. We have selected React and SemanticUI as the replacement framework for AngularJS.</p>
<p>The new Webpack build system released in Invenio v3.1 is part of the strategy to move from AngularJS to React (note however that you can use Webpack with your favorite framework, including AngularJS).</p>
<p>We have started the rewrite of Invenio-Search-JS and have already released the first version of <a href="https://inveniosoftware.github.io/react-searchkit/">React-SearckKit</a> which eventually will replace Invenio-Search-JS.</p>
<h1>Features removed in v3.1</h1>
<p>These following already deprecated features have been removed in Invenio v3.1.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invenio_records.tasks</code> was removed from the Invenio-Records module.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Maintenance policy</h1>
<p>Invenio v3.1 will be supported with bug and security fixes until the release of
Invenio v3.3 and minimum until 2020-03-31.</p>
<h1>What's next?</h1>
<p>We originally planned to release the Files and Statistics bundle in Invenio v3.1. We however decided it was more urgent to release the new Webpack build system in order to avoid too much code being written against the old build system.</p>
<p>In Invenio v3.2 we are planning to release the <strong>Files</strong> bundle including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://invenio-files-rest.readthedocs.io">invenio-files-rest</a><ul>
<li>Object storage REST API for Invenio with many supported backend storage
protocols and file integrity checking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://invenio-iiif.readthedocs.io">invenio-iiif</a><ul>
<li>International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) server for making
thumbnails and zooming images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://invenio-iiif.readthedocs.io">invenio-previewer</a><ul>
<li>Previewer for Markdown, JSON/XML, CSV, PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF and ZIP
files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://invenio-iiif.readthedocs.io">invenio-records-files</a><ul>
<li>Integration layer between object storage and records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <p>Welcome to Invenio 3!</p>
<p>We are proud to announce the release of Invenio v3.0.0. Invenio has been completely rewritten from scratch with a radically  improved architecture and technical implementation. Invenio 3 is now a framework, like a Swiss Army knife, complete with battle-tested, safe and secure modules providing all the features you need to build and run a trusted digital repository.</p>
<p>Whilst Invenio 3 is officially released to the world today, in reality it has already been relied upon in large-scale production systems for more than 1.5 years on sites such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zenodo.org">Zenodo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.cern.ch">CERN Open Data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://videos.cern.ch">CDS Videos</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also other sites are already in process of being built on Invenio 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>INSPIRE HEP - an aggregator for High-Energy Physics.</li>
<li>WEKO3 - repository platform for 500+ Japanese universities.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What's new</h1>
<p>Invenio functionality is being released in <strong>bundles</strong> of modules. Invenio v3 contains the following bundles totaling more than 27 individual Invenio modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base:</strong> the core application framework with e.g. distributed task queue support.</li>
<li><strong>Auth:</strong> accounts management, role-based access control, OAuth 2.0 client and provider, user profiles management.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata:</strong> record and persistent identifier management including indexing, querying and OAI-PMH server.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following bundles are being prepared for release in v3.1:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Files</strong>: advanced file management with multi-backend support as well as <a href="http://iiif.io/">IIIF Image API</a> support.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong>: <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/">COUNTER-compliant</a> statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>See our <a href="/roadmap/">roadmap</a> for further details.</p>

<h1>Compatibilities</h1>
<h3>Python compatibility</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0 supports Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6. We highly recommend only using the latest official release in each series.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 end-of-life is scheduled for April 2020. Invenio will only support Python 2.7 until that date. We highly recommend that all new projects are started on the latest available Python 3 version.</p>
<h3>Elasticsearch compatibility</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0 supports Elasticsearch 2, 5 and 6.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch v2 has reached end-of-life (February 2018) and Invenio v3.0 is the last release to support Elasticsearch v2.</p>
<h3>PostgreSQL compatibility</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0 supports PostgreSQL 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6. We have not yet tested Invenio v3.0 with PostgreSQL 10.</p>
<h3>MySQL compatibility</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0 supports MySQL 5.6+.</p>
<h1>Deprecations</h1>
<h3>AMD/RequireJS</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0's current static assets management system is based on e.g. RequireJS will be replaced with Webpack.
We expect this work to be ready for Invenio v3.1, and thus we are already deprecating the current support. Specifically this
means that Invenio-Assets and Invenio-Theme will change significantly in Invenio v3.1. We would have liked to
already have this ready for this v3.0 release, but unfortunately it was time-wise not possible.</p>
<h3>AngularJS</h3>
<p>Invenio v3.0 comes with one AngularJS 1.4 application (Invenio-Search-JS). AngularJS is by now already outdated, and we are
planning a rewrite of the application in another JavaScript framework that is currently in process of being selected.
Essentially this means that you should not extend Invenio-Search-JS at this point, since it will change significantly.</p>
<h1>Maintenance policy</h1>
<p>Invenio v3.0 will be supported with bug and security fixes until the release of
Invenio v3.2 and minimum one year.</p>
<p>We aim at one Invenio release with new features every 6 months. We expect
upgrades between minor versions (e.g. v3.1 to v3.2) to be fairly straight-forward
as in most cases only new features are added.</p>
