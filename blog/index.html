      <p>Caltech Library is pleased to announce that CaltechDATA, our institutional data and software repository, launched a major upgrade on Wednesday September 21, 2022.</p>
<p>CaltechDATA has served as critical research infrastructure for campus since 2017, and it hosts over 20,000 records containing datasets and software for a wide variety of disciplines. With this launch, CaltechDATA now runs on the open-source InvenioRDM platform and brings many new features that Caltech researchers have requested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier record creation with autocomplete for creators, affiliations, subjects, and funders</li>
<li>Automatic record versioning</li>
<li>Private share link for reviewers</li>
<li>Improved record views, with dynamic citations and an expanded file previewer</li>
</ul>
<p>This version of CaltechDATA also introduces communities, which enable groups at Caltech to create their own record curation and approval processes. Researchers can collect records into a single browse and search interface. A curation pipeline allows records to be submitted by Caltech users, and then approved by a defined set of curators. We’ve pre-seeded a small number of initial communities, and look forward to seeing what researchers create.</p>
<p>InvenioRDM is a customizable open-source repository platform developed by CERN and twenty partner organizations, including Caltech Library. It is built on the twenty-year history of the Invenio repository platform, whose most-successful implementation is the Zenodo generalist repository hosted by CERN. InvenioRDM takes the features of Zenodo and makes them customizable for institutions. InvenioRDM will enable Caltech Library to more rapidly roll out new features and collaborate with other institutions to establish repository best practices.</p>

      <p>On June 6, 2022 InvenioRDM partners from CERN, Northwestern University, TU Wien, NYU Libraries, and Cottage Labs assembled to present the InvenioRDM Workshop Day at Open Repositories 2022 (OR2022). At this first in-person meet-up in over two years, the team talked InvenioRDM with over 30 workshop attendees.</p>
<p>In the morning, participants were treated to Introduction and Installation presentations, followed by hands-on assistance with running InvenioRDM on their own machines. Attendees appreciated the one-on-one help and feedback and came away with a greater understanding of how to support the repository at their own institutions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, participants were treated to show-and-tell sessions on local customizations at both TU Wien and Northwestern, followed by an introductory session on partner benefits and how to join the community. Next followed fascinating in-depth presentations on increasing accessibility in InvenioRDM, building off the robust work in this field undertaken by NYU Libraries and Northwestern. A case study in data migration followed, and the afternoon wrapped with a presentation on local implementation and adoption approaches at NYU libraries, which incorporated feature and sprint-based development of repository policies. In addition, the InvenioRDM-based COVID-19 SSH Data Portal of the European University Institute was demoed by Cottage Labs.</p>
<p>The team was pleased to be able to share information and tips in person with potential adopters, and to experience some much-missed in-person teambuilding. Here’s hoping these meet-up opportunities increase in the future!</p>
<p>And although OR2022 unfortunately did not offer a hybrid option for attendance, the whole InvenioRDM community (and beyond) can experience the workshop day by visiting this <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/inveniordm-workshop-2022/">Zenodo community</a> to see individual presentations, the day’s itinerary, links to additional resources, and a feedback form.</p>
<p>If you’ll be attending a conference soon, and might be thinking of presenting on InvenioRDM, please let Sara or Lars know!</p>

<h3>Partners</h3>
<p>The development of InvenioRDM is the result of an Open Source project kicked
of 2 years ago with a diverse set of partners from all over academia and
research. Most of the development and testing work has been conducted during
the pandemic making it extra challenging for the people involved but also
in a fully online environment.</p>
<h3>Just the start</h3>
<p>This release is just the start. Our next major milestone is to bring Zenodo.org
on top of InvenioRDM, which means that most larger features have been shipped
along the way, and that the system have been fully tested against large-scale
heavy production loads.</p>

<p>Summer 2021 is an exciting time in the development of InvenioRDM, as the team works towards the Long-Term Support (LTS) version. Here are just a few updates we have to share about recent work:</p>
<h2>Contributions from the community</h2>
<p>InvenioRDM partners are not only local implementers, but frequently contribute their coding expertise to the project. Read <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/research/rti-support/research-data/news/news/tu-wien-contributes-to-inveniordm-development">this recent news item</a> about the efforts of TU Wien developer Maximilian Moser related to the share-by-link feature and the authentication modules.</p>
<h2>Usability testing</h2>
<p>One way that the entire community can contribute towards InvenioRDM development is to test the most recent version of the software either through your local implementation or at the <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/">CERN sandbox site</a>. Report any bugs you find using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdExcCjDUMTkaXCU9JHCBqeFfDuCW2kFQGbuZFrr3t77qHOsw/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a>. Timely and accurate bug reporting gives the entire project a boost!</p>
<h2>Getting the word out</h2>
<p>InvenioRDM will be featured in two sessions at <a href="https://or2021.openrepositories.org/">Open Repositories 2021, June 7-10</a>, “Poster Minute Madness” and the “Repository Rodeo”, both taking place on June 9. If you or someone you know would like an introduction to the software, encourage them to attend!</p>
<p>Are you presenting on InvenioRDM at an upcoming meeting? Please let us know using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhGtd39TqxleUkK-b5qyPqMjSg8EBqacxSpoDtydmE8/edit?usp=sharing">form</a>.</p>

      <h1>InvenioRDM v2.0</h1>
<p>We're happy to announce InvenioRDM v2.0!</p>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Want to try the new features in v2.0 - just head over to our demo site: <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/">https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/</a></p>
<p>If you want to install it, follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/">https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/</a></p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/versions/version-v2.0.0/">full release notes</a> and <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/upgrading/upgrade-v2.0/">upgrade instructions</a>.</p>
<h2>What's new?</h2>
<h3>Versioning support</h3>
<p>InvenioRDM now supports versioning for records. By default, InvenioRDM does not allow you to change the files after you have published a record. With the new versioning support, you can the files can now be changed however in <em>new versions</em> of the record.</p>
<h4>Creating new versions</h4>
<p>Now, a user can create a new version of the record, add or remove files and publish it by clicking the "New version" button.</p>
<p>One way to make new versions is from the record's landing page directly by clicking on the "New Version" button. Only allowed users can do so:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/landing-page.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another way is while editing a previously published record:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/deposit-form.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>Search results will by default only display the latest published version of a record. However, toggling the flip switch in the versions facet, allows you to view and search all versions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/search-results.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Landing page</h4>
<p>The landing page for previous versions of a record clearly displays that a newer version exists, with a link to it.</p>
<p>Also, in the right-hand column you have a link to view all published versions:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/landing-page-old.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p>We manage permissions at two levels when it comes to versioning.</p>
<p>Each specific version can have its own record/files visibility (e.g. one version can be restricted another not). Embargo dates also apply to specific versions.</p>
<p>Ownership of records, secret links (see below) and sharing of records is applied to all versions. So for instance, if you create a secret link to edit a record, that link will allow the holder to edit all versions of that record.</p>
<h3>Get an access link (REST API only)</h3>
<p>During this month, we have also added the capability in the REST API to create a shareable link (similar to the Share or Get a link feature on platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, ownCloud and the like). This link is interchangeably referred as an "access link", a "secret link" or a "shareable link".</p>
<p>You are able to create links with different permission, for instance to allow</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone with the link to view the metadata of a restricted record.</li>
<li>Anyone to access the restricted files of a record with public metadata.</li>
<li>Anyone with an account to edit a record.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the current limitations (that will be resolved further down the road) is that each secret link can only grant one permission, and they're not hierarchical (e.g. the permission to read files does not entail the permission to read the metadata).</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to also allow sharing only a preview of an unsubmitted record. This is particular useful for instance for peer-review scenarios, where a user can prepare a dataset and provide a journal with a link to the unpublished dataset. The peer-reviewer can then anonymously access the dataset, and the researcher can later update the dataset based on feedback from the peer-reviewer.</p>
<p>We plan to have a first minimal user interface for allowing users to use this new feature in the April release (v3.0). Below you see some of the mockups:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/share-button.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/get-a-link.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>A secret link can be created by sending a POST request to the record's access/links endpoint, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -H &quot;authorization: bearer &lt;PERSONAL_TOKEN&gt;&quot; -H &quot;content-type: application/json&quot; -d &#39;{&quot;permission&quot;: &quot;read&quot;}&#39; https://&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/api/records/&lt;RECID&gt;/access/links
</code></pre>
<p>If everything went well, the (JSON) response should contain a token. To use the token, it has to be specified in the query string of a URL, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>https://&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/records/&lt;RECID&gt;?token=&lt;TOKEN&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will grant the user the permission with which the secret link was created (even if they don't have an account).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Optionally, an expiration date (UTC timestamp) can be specified when creating a new secret link:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "permission": "read",
  "expires_at": "2021-12-31 23:55:00"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>The last major new feature is that you are now able to upgrade an InvenioRDM v1.0 instance to v2.0.</p>
<p>Do remember to make a backup of the database and files before performing the upgrade!</p>
<p>Please checkout the full <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/upgrading/upgrade-v2.0/">upgrade instructions</a>.</p>
<h4>REST API changes</h4>
<p>The JSON serializations for records in the REST API  have only changed slightly this month, mainly for the new versioning support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new top-level key <code>versions</code>.</li>
<li>Added new top-level key <code>parent</code>.</li>
<li>Moved the top-level key <code>conceptid</code> to <code>parent.id</code></li>
<li>Moved the <code>access.owned_by</code> to <code>parent.access.owned_by</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Database connection pooling: We have improved the disconnect handling of the database connection pool, so that connections are automatically opened/closed every hour.</li>
<li>Documentation: We have slightly reorganised the install/customize part of the documentation.</li>
<li>Documentation: We have slightly reorganised the REST API part of the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit form: When you create a new version, the files of the previous version are not transferred to the new version so you have to reupload everything.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are all carry-overs from the previous release:</p>
<p><strong>Landing page</strong></p>
<p>These are all carry-overs from the previous release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preview: The image previewer is not using IIIF and only previews images up to 500kb.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: If you e.g. upload a .JPG extension file, you can set the default preview for the file, but the list of files will not have a preview button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: The caption of the preview box does not change when selecting another file for preview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deposit form</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validation error messages: The form validation error messages are not displaying correctly. Labels are system names, and sometimes [Object (Object)] is displayed for errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Missing files: If files are missing to be uploaded, the publish button is disabled, but there is no feedback to the end-user that files are missing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance: We have seen some slight performance issues when entering information into the form. We're looking into this, to make sure it is not noticeable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affiliations vocabulary: We have not initialized the affiliation vocabulary, and thus there is no auto-completion for affiliations (creators and contributors).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Publish button: It is not enabled when reloading a page with a valid record - you first have to save the record for the publish button to be enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protection: The files restriction in the protection widget only become visible after uploading a file. It should be hidden only for metadata-only records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages: The language vocabulary search results are not ranked properly for the query. For instance searching for "english" will show less relevant results first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creators: The list of creators in the deposit form does not display the role nor identifier if entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The title of a search result item is not clickable even though it looks clickable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embargo records are not automatically published due to the missing background job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The REST API JSON serialization has timestamps that are not in UTC, nor do they have timezone information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some versions of NPM 7 are <em>known</em> to cause issues -- NPM 6.14.5 is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>For this particular release we're especially interested in hearing about your challenges and success about upgrading from v1.0 to v2.0.</p>
<p>Please post a message on the #rdm-general Discord channel.</p>
<p>For other issues, please first check if you've hit a known issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs: First check for known issues above, then report them on the <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues/new/choose">Invenio-App-RDM</a> repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>Feedback: Suggestions for improvements, results of user testing, etc. - please reach out to Lars directly (Discord chat or mail).</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's up next?</h2>
<p>During the April iteration (deadline April 30th) we're moving most of the CERN teams on top of InvenioRDM. This means, we'll be around 12 senior and junior developers working on InvenioRDM.</p>
<p>This in itself, poses its own challenges in onboarding new team members and reaching high productivity fast.</p>
<p>We'll be running three teams, each with its own focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Communites: The goal for this team is to integrate the creation of communities in InvenioRDM v3.0 (you will not yet be able to associate records with communities)</li>
<li>Team PIDs: The goal of this team is to ensure that InvenioRDM v3.0 can register DOIs for uploads.</li>
<li>Team QA: The goal for this team is to catch-up on left-overs from previous iterations, perform quality assurance and release management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The development work in this release was done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>CERN (Lars &amp; Zach)</li>
<li>Northwestern University (Guillaume)</li>
<li>TU Wien (Max)</li>

      <p>We're happy to announce InvenioRDM v1.0!</p>
<p>VERY IMPORTANT, read the full release notes before you install and run the system! The v1.0 label <strong>does not</strong> mean the system is suitable for <strong>production</strong> use!</p>
<h1>FAQ (do not skip!)</h1>
<h3>Can I use v1.0 in production?</h3>
<p>No. Do not even try, or think it might work out!</p>
<h3>When can I use InvenioRDM in production?</h3>
<p>The first release of InvenioRDM that you can use in a production system will be the LTS (Long-Term Support) release due in end-July.</p>
<h3>Why the v1.0 label?</h3>
<p>We follow semantic versioning, and in the coming months we'll be releasing v2.0, v3.0, etc. We use the v1.0 label because we're now in a state where the project partners can start running demo systems to demonstrate the progress of the project to their stakeholders. Furthermore, the project partners will be able to start user testing more widely.</p>
<h3>Can I upgrade from v1.0 to v2.0?</h3>
<p>Read the upgrade contract below.</p>
<h1>Upgrade contract (do not skip!)</h1>
<p>The following "contract" is meant to align expectations on how and what you'll be able to upgrade from v1.0 to v2.0.</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> expect <strong>breaking changes</strong> to anything on subsequent releases until the LTS release! REST APIs, programmatic APIs, features, Jinja/React templates, data model, vocabularies, etc.</p>
<p>We will <strong>ONLY</strong> guarantee that you will be able to upgrade a database created with v1.0 to v2.0. With that, we mean that <strong>through a manual, labour intensive and offline process</strong> you'll be able to upgrade your database. Basically this boils down to, that we will document the steps you need to apply in order to move your data from v1.0 to v2.0 code. In no way do we promise it will be easy! You <strong>MAY</strong> need to apply manual changes to records. We of course plan to make this an easy and smooth process for the LTS release, but for now it's not.</p>
<h1>What's new?</h1>
<p>Now that you've hopefully read all the above and are very scared of installing InvenioRDM in production (you should be!), then let's share a bit of the excitement we have for the release this month.</p>
<p>We have reached a really major milestone for InvenioRDM. We now have a <em>minimal</em> working repository with a <em>minimal</em> acceptable user experience with a <em>very minimal</em> feature set. From now on, we are in a releaseable state! That means that in the coming months we'll be improving the UX, the feature set, the stability and production readiness, and thus we're in a very good position for accomplishing our production-ready LTS release in end-July.</p>
<p>Below you'll find the specific areas we've been working on this month.</p>
<h3>Access control</h3>
<p>The major new feature this month is the support for minimal access control.</p>
<p>The deposit form now has a new protection widget that allows you to deposit records in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public records with public files</li>
<li>Public records with restricted files (with or without embargo)</li>
<li>Restricted records with restricted files (with or without embargo)</li>
<li>Public metadata-only records</li>
<li>Restricted metadata-only records (with or without embargo).</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some examples of how this now looks in the deposit form:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/1_access_control_examples.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Restricted records and files</strong></p>
<p>Restricted records and files are only visible for the owner (the user who deposited the material). This means that e.g. a restricted record will not show up in the search results of other users.</p>
<p>User without access (no files and no edit button visible):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/2_access_control_restricted_files.png" alt=""></p>
<p>User with access (files and edit button visible):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/3_access_control_owner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note, that the message "Sorry, the files are restricted!" is a temporary message, until we have a solution for the access badge (see next section).</p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Access status</strong></p>
<p>We have temporarily removed the access status badge (see before/after screenshot below) until we have found a suitable solution for the badge. The current badge was not easily transferable to the new access control, and is mixing indications about if you can access a record, and/or if files are available.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/4_access_badge_before.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/5_access_badge_after.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Embargo feature</strong></p>
<p>You can apply an embargo period to restricted files or records. Once an embargo period is over the record/files are supposed to be made automatically publicly accessible. In v1.0 however, we were not able to include the background job responsible for doing this automatically.</p>
<p>We'll ship this task in the March v2.0 release.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation: Manage permissions</strong></p>
<p>Currently, only the owner is able to see a restricted record/files. In future releases, we'll of course add the support for managing permissions, so that restricted records and files can be shared with colleagues, groups and entire institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Access backend</strong></p>
<p>Underneath the hood, we have prepared the entire access control system to be able to share access with other users, communities, IP networks, etc. Thus, the backend part for allowing management of permissions is almost done, while we are primarily missing the frontend that allows an end-user to interact with the permission system.</p>
<h3>Minimal UX</h3>
<p><strong>Disabled unfinished features</strong></p>
<p>We have disabled all unfinished features from the user interface. We have for instance disabled the communities module, the version flip-switch in search results, a button to the advanced search and so on.</p>
<p>The features will be added back, once they have reached sufficient quality to be running in a demo system.</p>
<p><strong>Deposit form fields</strong></p>
<p>We have also removed all deposit form fields from the user interface that were not ready. Each of these fields will be added back progressively as they are finished. Most notably we e.g. had to remove the subjects field for this release.</p>
<p><strong>Field help text</strong></p>
<p>We have added help text to as many fields as possible. Please provide feedback, if they are understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Styling issues</strong></p>
<p>We have fixed a large number of small styling and consistentcy issues. Still some remain, and you're feedback is very much appreciated on anything you find in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<p>The list uploads page now has a nice greeting for first time users:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/6_list_uploads_empty.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, the overall styling of the page was improved:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-26-february-release/7_list_uploads_styling.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Search guide</strong></p>
<p>We have added a guide (taken from Zenodo) on how to perform advanced queries. See it on <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/help/search">https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/help/search</a>.</p>
<h3>Release v1.0</h3>
<p>We have gone through a lot of quality checking to ensure that we'll be able to upgrade data created with the v1.0 release to the coming v2.0 release. This work has focused on ensuring, for example, proper validation and integrity of the data that makes it into the database.</p>
<p>We have also ensured that all database tables have proper upgrade recipes for our automatic schema upgrade system (Alembic).</p>
<h1>Known issues</h1>
<p><strong>Landing page</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preview: The image previewer is not using IIIF and only previews images up to 500kb.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: If you e.g. upload a .JPG extension file, you can set the default preview for the file, but the list of files will not have a preview button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: The caption of the preview box does not change when selecting another file for preview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deposit form</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validation error messages: The form validation error messages are not displaying correctly. Labels are system names, and sometimes [Object (Object)] is displayed for errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Missing files: If files are missing to be uploaded, the publish button is disabled, but there no feedback to the end-user that files are missing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance: We have seen some slight performance issues when entering information into the form. We're looking into this, to make sure it is not noticeable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affiliations vocabulary: We have not initialized the affiliation vocabulary, and thus there is no auto-completion for affiliations (creators and contributors).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Publish button: It is not enabled when reloading a page with a valid record - you first have to save the record for the publish button to be enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protection: The files restriction in the protection widget only become visible after uploading a file. It should be hidden only for metadata-only records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages: The language vocabulary search results are not ranked properly for the query. For instance searching for "english" will show less relevant results first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creators: The list of creators in the deposit form does not display the role nor identifier if entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) in the description fields are not removed from the descriptions displayed in search results, causing them to be printed verbatim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Facet: The search facet distinguishing between published and drafts on the list uploads page is using system labels instead of human readable labels.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The title of a search result item is not clickable even though it looks clickable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embargo records are not automatically published due to the missing background job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The REST API JSON serialization has timestamps that are not in UTC, nor do they have timezone information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some versions of NPM 7 are <em>known</em> to cause issues -- NPM 6.14.5 is recommended.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="blog-list-item-content">
      <p>2020 didn't stop us from shipping new releases. 2021 won't either. We’re excited to announce the InvenioRDM Alpha 15 (January release)! Thank you to our team members for their efforts on this release.</p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>This month was primarily dedicated to improving the user experience of the deposit form.</p>
<p>We have made significant improvements to the overall user experience of the deposit form. That said, we still have many smaller UX improvements to make. This work will continue throughout February.</p>
<h3>Creators/Contributors</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/creators_contributors.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The creators/contributors fields have gotten a complete makeover that significantly reduces the clutter. We have optimized the new creators field for adding basic information (name/affiliation) as well as linking the affiliation field to vocabulary records (e.g. ROR). We postponed the more advanced use case of allowing the user to edit all fields such as identifier scheme and identifiers for affiliations, as this created an overly complex form for the majority of use cases.</p>
<p>The creator field we imagine can be extended in the future with support for importing authors via predefined files (e.g. BibTex, etc.).</p>
<p>One particular feature to highlight is that the name identifiers field now does automatic detection of the identifier scheme. You can now paste an ORCID (e.g. an ORCID URL), and the backend will automatically detect it as an ORCID and normalise the stored value.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/creators_names.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/coming_soon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have decided to hide certain fields that we know need further work. You'll see these as "Coming soon". Also, we have temporarily removed the language field from titles and descriptions as we had last minute issues with these fields.</p>
<h3>Minor UX Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sticky side bar: The side bar with the save/publish buttons, is now sticky so it will follow you when you scroll down the form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Resource type: The drop-down was reduced from two drop-downs to a single drop-down to reduce the number of needed clicks to select a resource type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete/discard button: There's now a delete button that you can use to delete your draft or discard edits to a published record.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Button consistency: We have applied consistent styling, wording and and naming to most buttons.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Errors for inline fields are now consistently displayed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Brand color: We have now made it easier to customize the styling of the field groups via a common brand color. Previously, if your header was purple, the field groups would remain blue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File warning: The warning displayed under the files section was updated to match Semantic UI styling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Field help text: We've added an example of field help text to the Dates field, which will expand to all fields needing it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Array fields styling: dates, related identifiers and titles are now properly using the entire form grid from side to side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-02-01-january-release/dates.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consistent naming of related work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Title: The deposit form now has a title.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Vocabularies: The vocabularies REST API received some significant backend changes, which means that we can now properly show translated text in auto-completion fields such as languages, license, affiliations, and subjects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extended Date Time Format indexing: We now have support for searching EDTF date ranges properly (contributed by TU Wien).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Geospatial indexing: We are now able to properly index almost any GeoJSON data type (points, boxes, polygons, etc.) so that they  can be searched properly at a later point. They are indexed via their centroid which is computed using the Shapely library (contributed by Cottage Labs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Core API methods needed for reindexing of vocabularies was added as well (contributed by EU JRC).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prettyprint: If you explore the REST API in a browser, you can now add <code>?prettyprint=1</code> to the URL, and the JSON will be nicely formatted for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discarding a change to an edited record doesn't work.</li>
<li>Licenses cannot be saved.</li>
<li>Languages cannot be saved and only Danish and English are currently available.</li>
<li>License data is missing.</li>
<li>Error messages at the top of the form are not displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>If you previously installed InvenioRDM, make sure you have the latest Docker image of your choice according to the Python version:</p>
<pre><code>docker pull inveniosoftware/centos7-python:3.6
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.7
docker pull inveniosoftware/centos8-python:3.8
</code></pre>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade invenio-cli
invenio-cli init rdm
cd my-site
invenio-cli containerize --pre
invenio-cli demo --containers
</code></pre>
<p>This month's version of invenio-cli is 0.21.0 .</p>
<p>To stop the instance without destroying the records that were created, you can just run:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-site
invenio-cli stop
</code></pre>
<p>To destroy the Python virtualenv, and remove the docker containers, you can now just run:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-site
invenio-cli destroy
</code></pre>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>As always, we welcome your feedback. When you provide feedback on Discourse your message should be pre-populated with the classic template (bugs, what worked well, what didn’t work well, wishes for documentation).</p>
<p>Here is the template to give feedback if it’s not automated:</p>
<pre><code>## Bugs

## What worked well

## What didn't work well

## Wishes for documentation
</code></pre>
<p>Take care and stay safe!</p>

      <p>We’re excited to announce the InvenioRDM Alpha 14 (December release)! Thank you to our team members for their efforts on this release.</p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<h3>Vocabularies support</h3>
<p>The focus of the December release was to add support for linking bibliographic records with authority records such as subjects, grants, licenses, languages and more.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-complete on deposit fields</li>
<li>Facet searches based on vocabulary values</li>
<li>Support for internationalization on deposit, on facets, etc.</li>
<li>REST APIs for vocabularies</li>
<li>Linking of records in the backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deposit form autocompletion</h3>
<p>The most visible way to see the vocabularies in action is via the deposit form fields.</p>
<p>The below components were added in the deposit form and they support vocabulary autocompletion:</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>
<p>You can see the autocomplete search help:</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_0f6a4248b6ade70453232a3169a0be3e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And an example of i18n support, when the instance is in Turkish:</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_1162c1cc0d211cd2bb7e4eddde1480fd.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Licenses (preview)</strong></p>
<p>We have added support for both standard and custom licenses. Note that we were not able to fully complete this work, and there are known bugs in the license widget. Most notably you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search field does not allow spaces</li>
<li>Link not working</li>
<li>UX issues such as over-long page</li>
<li>Descriptions for licenses not available.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_a84cfafab881af6e3019e731bcb7f262.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Subjects (preview)</strong></p>
<p>The subjects field autocompletes from a subjects vocabulary that can host multiple different vocabularies at the same time.</p>
<p>The current version is not yet connected with the API, thus it has some demonstration values instead. Only the values you see in the image below can be selected. Don't save a record with subjects yet either.</p>

<h3>Invenio v3.4</h3>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of the December Invenio sprint, Invenio v3.4 was released (see more <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/2020-12-17-invenio-v340-released/">here</a>). The release of Invenio v3.4 was an important step for InvenioRDM. We now depend on stable releases of Semantic UI.</p>
<h3>Partial save and error reporting</h3>
<p>This release includes support for partial validation on draft creation. It also displays partial saves in the uploads page, for example with "No title" if the title was not included in the draft.</p>
<p>For example, saving an empty draft will tell you precisely what is missing at the top, along with pointers per field (see <code>title</code> at the bottom of the image).</p>
<p><img src="https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_39a402a38eaa38e8de0b11769e33b121.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The former error space will update to good (green) once you save a draft that is publication-ready. The publish button will then be enabled.</p>
