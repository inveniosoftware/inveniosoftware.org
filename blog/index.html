<p>The Prism institutional repository has launched at Northwestern University. Prism preserves and makes available articles, conference presentations, preprints, datasets, and other items created by faculty, staff, and students. Prism helps openness, maximizes reproducibility, and enhances research connections within Feinberg School of Medicine and across the globe.</p>
<p>Prism replaces the former DigitalHub and includes many much-anticipated features, such as the ability to create metadata-only records for offsite datasets, set embargo dates for releasing content to the public, create and curate communities of practice, and share private links to view and edit with colleagues. These new features complement existing features such as the ability to assign Digital Object Identifiers that make records citable, indexing by Google to make research widely discoverable, and a responsive staff at Galter Library to answer questions and provide support.</p>
<p>Kristi Holmes, the Director of Galter Health Sciences Library, Associate Dean of Knowledge Management and Strategy, and professor of Preventive Medicine, played a leading role in the development of Prism. According to Holmes, “It is essential to have a robust institutional repository that can keep up with the latest technologies and trends. As models for open access and data sharing continue to evolve, it's clear that institutional repositories will play an increasingly critical role to make research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).” She continues, “What makes this project particularly special is the strong collaborative approach we’ve taken both at Northwestern and also in partnership with the larger open source community. I’m grateful to our team at Galter Library for their incredible work.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce the launch of Prism as the institutional repository for Feinberg School of Medicine” says Karen Gutzman, Head of Research Assessment and Communications at Galter Health Sciences Library and Learning Center. Prism builds on a strong research foundation first made possible in the DigitalHub repository. “One of the most exciting features of Prism is the ability to create communities on topics, projects, or events” says Gutzman. Communities include open access research from Feinberg on <a href="https://prism.northwestern.edu/communities/covid-19-community?q=&amp;l=list&amp;p=1&amp;s=10&amp;sort=newest">COVID-19</a>, training presentations from the <a href="https://prism.northwestern.edu/communities/biostatistics-collaboration-center-lecture-series?q=&amp;l=list&amp;p=1&amp;s=10&amp;sort=newest">Biostatistics Collaboration Center</a>, and the NUCATS Grant Repository, a centralized resource for grant writers and investigators internal to Northwestern provided by the NUCATS Institute. “Prism is an excellent home for the NUCATS Grants Repository, allowing us to easily share exemplar grant templates and other resources with investigators across the Northwestern University community,” says Dr. Richard D’Aquila, Director of NUCATS.</p>
<p>Prism is built on the InvenioRDM software, which also forms a strong and sustainable foundation for Zenodo. “With its user-friendly interface and advanced features, InvenioRDM is truly a game-changer in the world of repositories. This platform is designed to make research more accessible and open to the public, promoting innovation and collaboration within the academic community,” says Holmes. Over the past several years, CERN and Northwestern have collaborated as core co-developers of the software, partnering with the global Invenio Open Source Community to develop InvenioRDM as a turnkey, scalable, and top-of-the-class user experience software for repositories. The InvenioRDM software offers a reliable environment for science, empowering preservation, credit, discovery, and sharing while maintaining integrity in its responsiveness to the evolving needs of the research community, including data sharing policy compliance. Northwestern contributions to the open source project are led by Matt Carson, Senior Data Scientist and Head of the Galter Library Digital Systems Department, with developer Guillaume Viger leading technical work and Sara Gonzales, Senior Data Librarian at Galter Library, contributing to a wide range of efforts, including serving as the Community Manager.</p>
<p>Notably, Northwestern and CERN recently expanded this collaboration through an <a href="https://blog.zenodo.org/2022/09/30/2022-09-30-northwestern-cern-join-nih-in-enhancing-access-to-biomedical-research/">award</a> from the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy/Office of the NIH Director pursuant to OTA-21-009, <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/generalist-repository-ecosystem-initiative">Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)</a>, to Zenodo to help researchers improve discoverability of their data and lead to greater reproducibility and reuse of data. Through this award and others, the infrastructure reflects <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/05/30/nstc-desirable-characteristics-of-data-repositories-for-federally-funded-research/">Desirable Characteristics of Data Repositories for Federally Funded Research</a> and continues to evolve to meet research needs and support a vibrant data ecosystem.</p>

<p>Last month InvenioRDM project partners convened in Stellenbosch and Cape Town, South Africa for the 18th International <a href="https://www.conftool.net/or2023/sessions.php">Open Repositories Conference</a> (OR2023). We were thrilled to offer our second InvenioRDM workshop on the 12th of June (see our wrap-up of the first workshop: <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/2022-07-06-OR2022-spotlight/">OR2022 workshop</a>). During three eventful hours we spoke with librarians, data managers, administrators, and developers about the basics of joining the InvenioRDM project and standing up an instance. We also shared information on customizations and add-ons for those interested in the platform’s advanced capabilities.</p>
<p>Following Nicola Tarocco’s introduction and demo of key InvenioRDM functions and features, our sessions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximilian Moser’s presentation on customizations for his local InvenioRDM instance <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8025768">TU Wien Research Data</a>, as well as a CLI command enabling very large file upload</li>
<li>Dan Granville’s presentation on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8021740">IIIF in InvenioRDM</a>, exemplified through his work with <a href="https://data-futures.org/">Data Futures GmbH</a></li>
<li>Guillaume Viger’s presentation on the launch of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8023551">Northwestern University’s Prism</a> instance, with a particular focus on successful migration of awkward data</li>
<li>Matt Carson’s presentation on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8025605">InvenioRDM’s support of the FAIR principles</a>, with additional information on the platform’s support for data policy initiatives</li>
<li>Maximilian and Guillaume’s presentation on the details of, and endless possibilities for, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8025764">deployment of InvenioRDM instances</a></li>
<li>Zacharodimos Zacharias’ presentation on his and the CERN team’s iterative and productive efforts to achieve fast and efficient <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8023567">data migration</a> as a test for Zenodo’s move to InvenioRDM later this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop attendees were engaged, brought great questions, and gave us much food for thought. Our conversations with potential new partners were so extensive that we were not able to include all planned presentations! Be on the lookout for future blog posts containing this bonus content.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! InvenioRDM’s OR2023 representation included Nicola’s fantastic lightning talk on behalf of InvenioRDM in the annual <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8121201">Repository Rodeo</a>. In addition, Maximilian Moser and David Eckhard of TU Graz presented their work on a communication protocol to connect <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8054753">machine-actionable DMPs with InvenioRDM</a>, and Zacharodimos Zacharias presented on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8074996">InvenioRDM’s mature integration</a> with <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a> (the Research Organization Registry).</p>
<p>All of the InvenioRDM Workshop Day presentations are now available for download from <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/inveniordm-workshop-2023/?page=1&amp;size=20">Zenodo</a>. We hope to host another InvenioRDM workshop at the <a href="https://or2024.openrepositories.org/">19th Annual Open Repositories Conference</a> June 3-6th, 2024 in Gothenburg, Sweden. If we’ve missed you at our previous two workshops, we hope to see you there!</p>

      <p><img src="/blog/2023-06-26-june-inveniordm-github-archiver/CaltechDATA.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) is a new software tool created by the Caltech Library. <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/">InvenioRDM</a> is the basis for many institutional repositories, such as <a href="https://data.caltech.edu/">CaltechDATA</a>, that enable users to preserve software and data sets in a long-term archive. The metadata contained in the record of a deposit is critical to making the record widely discoverable by other people. However, creating detailed records and uploading assets can be a tedious and error-prone process if done manually. This is where our new tool comes in.</p>
<p>IGA creates metadata records and sends releases automatically from GitHub to an InvenioRDM-based repository server. It constructs a metadata record using information it gathers from the software release, the GitHub repository, the GitHub API, and various other APIs as needed. Here are some of IGA’s other notable features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic metadata extraction from GitHub releases, repositories, and <code>codemeta.json</code> and <code>CITATION.cff</code> files</li>
<li>Thorough coverage of <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata">InvenioRDM record metadata</a> using painstaking procedures</li>
<li>Recognition of identifiers that appear in CodeMeta and CFF files, including <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCiD</a>, <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/public-access-info/">PMCID</a></li>
<li>Automatic lookup of publication data in <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI.org</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>, Google Books, &amp; other sources if needed</li>
<li>Automatic lookup of organization names in <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a> (assuming ROR id’s are provided)</li>
<li>Automatic lookup of human names in <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCiD.org</a> if needed (assuming ORCID id’s are provided)</li>
<li>Automatic splitting of human names into family and given names using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">ML</a>-based methods if necessary</li>
<li>Support for record versioning</li>
<li>Support for InvenioRDM <a href="https://invenio-communities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">communities</a></li>
<li>Support for overriding the metadata record IGA creates, for complete control if you need it</li>
<li>Ability to use the GitHub API without a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">GitHub access token</a> in many cases</li>
<li>Extensive use of logging so you can see what’s going on under the hood</li>
</ul>
<p>Data and software archived in a repository need to be described thoroughly and richly cross-referenced in order to be widely discoverable by other people. Of particular interest to software developers is that a repository like CaltechDATA offers the means to preserve software projects in a long-term archive managed by their institution. IGA helps make the creation of metadata and InvenioRDM records for software and data managed in GitHub as easy as possible.</p>

      <p>Caltech Library is pleased to announce that CaltechDATA, our institutional data and software repository, launched a major upgrade on Wednesday September 21, 2022.</p>
<p>CaltechDATA has served as critical research infrastructure for campus since 2017, and it hosts over 20,000 records containing datasets and software for a wide variety of disciplines. With this launch, CaltechDATA now runs on the open-source InvenioRDM platform and brings many new features that Caltech researchers have requested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier record creation with autocomplete for creators, affiliations, subjects, and funders</li>
<li>Automatic record versioning</li>
<li>Private share link for reviewers</li>
<li>Improved record views, with dynamic citations and an expanded file previewer</li>
</ul>
<p>This version of CaltechDATA also introduces communities, which enable groups at Caltech to create their own record curation and approval processes. Researchers can collect records into a single browse and search interface. A curation pipeline allows records to be submitted by Caltech users, and then approved by a defined set of curators. We’ve pre-seeded a small number of initial communities, and look forward to seeing what researchers create.</p>
<p>InvenioRDM is a customizable open-source repository platform developed by CERN and twenty partner organizations, including Caltech Library. It is built on the twenty-year history of the Invenio repository platform, whose most-successful implementation is the Zenodo generalist repository hosted by CERN. InvenioRDM takes the features of Zenodo and makes them customizable for institutions. InvenioRDM will enable Caltech Library to more rapidly roll out new features and collaborate with other institutions to establish repository best practices.</p>

      <p>On June 6, 2022 InvenioRDM partners from CERN, Northwestern University, TU Wien, NYU Libraries, and Cottage Labs assembled to present the InvenioRDM Workshop Day at Open Repositories 2022 (OR2022). At this first in-person meet-up in over two years, the team talked InvenioRDM with over 30 workshop attendees.</p>
<p>In the morning, participants were treated to Introduction and Installation presentations, followed by hands-on assistance with running InvenioRDM on their own machines. Attendees appreciated the one-on-one help and feedback and came away with a greater understanding of how to support the repository at their own institutions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, participants were treated to show-and-tell sessions on local customizations at both TU Wien and Northwestern, followed by an introductory session on partner benefits and how to join the community. Next followed fascinating in-depth presentations on increasing accessibility in InvenioRDM, building off the robust work in this field undertaken by NYU Libraries and Northwestern. A case study in data migration followed, and the afternoon wrapped with a presentation on local implementation and adoption approaches at NYU libraries, which incorporated feature and sprint-based development of repository policies. In addition, the InvenioRDM-based COVID-19 SSH Data Portal of the European University Institute was demoed by Cottage Labs.</p>
<p>The team was pleased to be able to share information and tips in person with potential adopters, and to experience some much-missed in-person teambuilding. Here’s hoping these meet-up opportunities increase in the future!</p>
<p>And although OR2022 unfortunately did not offer a hybrid option for attendance, the whole InvenioRDM community (and beyond) can experience the workshop day by visiting this <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/inveniordm-workshop-2022/">Zenodo community</a> to see individual presentations, the day’s itinerary, links to additional resources, and a feedback form.</p>
<p>If you’ll be attending a conference soon, and might be thinking of presenting on InvenioRDM, please let Sara or Lars know!</p>

<h3>Partners</h3>
<p>The development of InvenioRDM is the result of an Open Source project kicked
of 2 years ago with a diverse set of partners from all over academia and
research. Most of the development and testing work has been conducted during
the pandemic making it extra challenging for the people involved but also
in a fully online environment.</p>
<h3>Just the start</h3>
<p>This release is just the start. Our next major milestone is to bring Zenodo.org
on top of InvenioRDM, which means that most larger features have been shipped
along the way, and that the system have been fully tested against large-scale
heavy production loads.</p>

<p>Summer 2021 is an exciting time in the development of InvenioRDM, as the team works towards the Long-Term Support (LTS) version. Here are just a few updates we have to share about recent work:</p>
<h2>Contributions from the community</h2>
<p>InvenioRDM partners are not only local implementers, but frequently contribute their coding expertise to the project. Read <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/research/rti-support/research-data/news/news/tu-wien-contributes-to-inveniordm-development">this recent news item</a> about the efforts of TU Wien developer Maximilian Moser related to the share-by-link feature and the authentication modules.</p>
<h2>Usability testing</h2>
<p>One way that the entire community can contribute towards InvenioRDM development is to test the most recent version of the software either through your local implementation or at the <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/">CERN sandbox site</a>. Report any bugs you find using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdExcCjDUMTkaXCU9JHCBqeFfDuCW2kFQGbuZFrr3t77qHOsw/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a>. Timely and accurate bug reporting gives the entire project a boost!</p>
<h2>Getting the word out</h2>
<p>InvenioRDM will be featured in two sessions at <a href="https://or2021.openrepositories.org/">Open Repositories 2021, June 7-10</a>, “Poster Minute Madness” and the “Repository Rodeo”, both taking place on June 9. If you or someone you know would like an introduction to the software, encourage them to attend!</p>
<p>Are you presenting on InvenioRDM at an upcoming meeting? Please let us know using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhGtd39TqxleUkK-b5qyPqMjSg8EBqacxSpoDtydmE8/edit?usp=sharing">form</a>.</p>

      <h1>InvenioRDM v2.0</h1>
<p>We're happy to announce InvenioRDM v2.0!</p>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Want to try the new features in v2.0 - just head over to our demo site: <a href="https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/">https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/</a></p>
<p>If you want to install it, follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/">https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/</a></p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/versions/version-v2.0.0/">full release notes</a> and <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/upgrading/upgrade-v2.0/">upgrade instructions</a>.</p>
<h2>What's new?</h2>
<h3>Versioning support</h3>
<p>InvenioRDM now supports versioning for records. By default, InvenioRDM does not allow you to change the files after you have published a record. With the new versioning support, you can the files can now be changed however in <em>new versions</em> of the record.</p>
<h4>Creating new versions</h4>
<p>Now, a user can create a new version of the record, add or remove files and publish it by clicking the "New version" button.</p>
<p>One way to make new versions is from the record's landing page directly by clicking on the "New Version" button. Only allowed users can do so:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/landing-page.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another way is while editing a previously published record:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/deposit-form.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>Search results will by default only display the latest published version of a record. However, toggling the flip switch in the versions facet, allows you to view and search all versions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/search-results.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Landing page</h4>
<p>The landing page for previous versions of a record clearly displays that a newer version exists, with a link to it.</p>
<p>Also, in the right-hand column you have a link to view all published versions:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/landing-page-old.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p>We manage permissions at two levels when it comes to versioning.</p>
<p>Each specific version can have its own record/files visibility (e.g. one version can be restricted another not). Embargo dates also apply to specific versions.</p>
<p>Ownership of records, secret links (see below) and sharing of records is applied to all versions. So for instance, if you create a secret link to edit a record, that link will allow the holder to edit all versions of that record.</p>
<h3>Get an access link (REST API only)</h3>
<p>During this month, we have also added the capability in the REST API to create a shareable link (similar to the Share or Get a link feature on platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, ownCloud and the like). This link is interchangeably referred as an "access link", a "secret link" or a "shareable link".</p>
<p>You are able to create links with different permission, for instance to allow</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone with the link to view the metadata of a restricted record.</li>
<li>Anyone to access the restricted files of a record with public metadata.</li>
<li>Anyone with an account to edit a record.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the current limitations (that will be resolved further down the road) is that each secret link can only grant one permission, and they're not hierarchical (e.g. the permission to read files does not entail the permission to read the metadata).</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to also allow sharing only a preview of an unsubmitted record. This is particular useful for instance for peer-review scenarios, where a user can prepare a dataset and provide a journal with a link to the unpublished dataset. The peer-reviewer can then anonymously access the dataset, and the researcher can later update the dataset based on feedback from the peer-reviewer.</p>
<p>We plan to have a first minimal user interface for allowing users to use this new feature in the April release (v3.0). Below you see some of the mockups:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/share-button.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021-03-26-inveniordm-v20/get-a-link.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>A secret link can be created by sending a POST request to the record's access/links endpoint, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -H &quot;authorization: bearer &lt;PERSONAL_TOKEN&gt;&quot; -H &quot;content-type: application/json&quot; -d &#39;{&quot;permission&quot;: &quot;read&quot;}&#39; https://&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/api/records/&lt;RECID&gt;/access/links
</code></pre>
<p>If everything went well, the (JSON) response should contain a token. To use the token, it has to be specified in the query string of a URL, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>https://&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/records/&lt;RECID&gt;?token=&lt;TOKEN&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will grant the user the permission with which the secret link was created (even if they don't have an account).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Optionally, an expiration date (UTC timestamp) can be specified when creating a new secret link:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "permission": "read",
  "expires_at": "2021-12-31 23:55:00"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>The last major new feature is that you are now able to upgrade an InvenioRDM v1.0 instance to v2.0.</p>
<p>Do remember to make a backup of the database and files before performing the upgrade!</p>
<p>Please checkout the full <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/upgrading/upgrade-v2.0/">upgrade instructions</a>.</p>
<h4>REST API changes</h4>
<p>The JSON serializations for records in the REST API  have only changed slightly this month, mainly for the new versioning support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new top-level key <code>versions</code>.</li>
<li>Added new top-level key <code>parent</code>.</li>
<li>Moved the top-level key <code>conceptid</code> to <code>parent.id</code></li>
<li>Moved the <code>access.owned_by</code> to <code>parent.access.owned_by</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Database connection pooling: We have improved the disconnect handling of the database connection pool, so that connections are automatically opened/closed every hour.</li>
<li>Documentation: We have slightly reorganised the install/customize part of the documentation.</li>
<li>Documentation: We have slightly reorganised the REST API part of the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit form: When you create a new version, the files of the previous version are not transferred to the new version so you have to reupload everything.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are all carry-overs from the previous release:</p>
<p><strong>Landing page</strong></p>
<p>These are all carry-overs from the previous release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preview: The image previewer is not using IIIF and only previews images up to 500kb.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: If you e.g. upload a .JPG extension file, you can set the default preview for the file, but the list of files will not have a preview button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Preview: The caption of the preview box does not change when selecting another file for preview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deposit form</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validation error messages: The form validation error messages are not displaying correctly. Labels are system names, and sometimes [Object (Object)] is displayed for errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Missing files: If files are missing to be uploaded, the publish button is disabled, but there is no feedback to the end-user that files are missing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance: We have seen some slight performance issues when entering information into the form. We're looking into this, to make sure it is not noticeable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affiliations vocabulary: We have not initialized the affiliation vocabulary, and thus there is no auto-completion for affiliations (creators and contributors).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Publish button: It is not enabled when reloading a page with a valid record - you first have to save the record for the publish button to be enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protection: The files restriction in the protection widget only become visible after uploading a file. It should be hidden only for metadata-only records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages: The language vocabulary search results are not ranked properly for the query. For instance searching for "english" will show less relevant results first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creators: The list of creators in the deposit form does not display the role nor identifier if entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List uploads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The title of a search result item is not clickable even though it looks clickable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embargo records are not automatically published due to the missing background job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The REST API JSON serialization has timestamps that are not in UTC, nor do they have timezone information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some versions of NPM 7 are <em>known</em> to cause issues -- NPM 6.14.5 is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>For this particular release we're especially interested in hearing about your challenges and success about upgrading from v1.0 to v2.0.</p>
<p>Please post a message on the #rdm-general Discord channel.</p>
<p>For other issues, please first check if you've hit a known issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs: First check for known issues above, then report them on the <a href="https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues/new/choose">Invenio-App-RDM</a> repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>Feedback: Suggestions for improvements, results of user testing, etc. - please reach out to Lars directly (Discord chat or mail).</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's up next?</h2>
<p>During the April iteration (deadline April 30th) we're moving most of the CERN teams on top of InvenioRDM. This means, we'll be around 12 senior and junior developers working on InvenioRDM.</p>
<p>This in itself, poses its own challenges in onboarding new team members and reaching high productivity fast.</p>
<p>We'll be running three teams, each with its own focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Communites: The goal for this team is to integrate the creation of communities in InvenioRDM v3.0 (you will not yet be able to associate records with communities)</li>
<li>Team PIDs: The goal of this team is to ensure that InvenioRDM v3.0 can register DOIs for uploads.</li>
<li>Team QA: The goal for this team is to catch-up on left-overs from previous iterations, perform quality assurance and release management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The development work in this release was done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>CERN (Lars &amp; Zach)</li>
<li>Northwestern University (Guillaume)</li>
<li>TU Wien (Max)</li>
</ul>
